```python
  # üëæ The f before a string literal in Python denotes an f-string, which is similar to template literals in JavaScript.
      print(f"{i+1}. {playlist[i]}")
#
#
# another example
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

```

<br>
<br>

### WHILE loop

- Just like in javascript

- careful with the never ending loop that will crash your browser, so dont **print** the below

```python
value = 1
while value < 10:
    print(value) # :stop_sign: DONT!!!

    #result
    # infinite loop
```

<br>
<br>

### Do this:

- add the `+= 1` its going to increment everytime it goes through the LOOP, until it reaches the 9 (as we are incrementing 1), which is the end point `< 10`

```python
value = 1
while value < 10:
    print(value)
    value += 1
#result
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
#It doesnt reach the 10, because the condition tells that "WHILE" its less than 10. if you want to show the 10, you can change the condition from < 10 to <= 10 (less or equal to 10)
value = 1
while value <= 10:
    print(value)
    value += 1
#result
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Another WAY to break the LOOP

```python
value = 1
while value <= 10:
    print(value)
    if value == 5:
        break #if the condition is met, it will stop the loop at 5
    value += 1
```

<br>
<br>

# ELSE

### üñêÔ∏è USING the else

- You can use it once the loop is completed and the condition is no longer TRUE

```python
while value <= 10:
  value += 1
  if value == 5:
     continue  # If value is 5, the loop skips the remaining code in this iteration and continues to the next iteration
  print(value)
  #
  # ELSE: You can use it once the loop is completed and the condition is no longer TRUE
  #
else:
    print("Value is now equal to " + value) #üßß You will get an error if you try to print this, so convert the TYPE

```

## üî¥ the error

```python
    print("Value is now equal to " +  value)
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

<br>

### üåà convert the TYPE to str (string)

```python
else:
    print("Value is now equal to " + str(value))
```

## üü° FOR loop (sequence)

<br>

#### chatgpt basict doc about the topic:

<br>

- In Python, a for **loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any other iterable object.**

> The basic syntax of a for loop in Python is:

```python

for item in sequence:
    # do something with item

```

#### The `for` keyword indicates the start of the loop.

- **item** is a variable that will take on the value of each element in the sequence during each iteration of the loop.

**sequence** is the collection of items over which the loop will iterate.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#
# fruit will represent the content within the fruits list/ array(js)
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

<br>

### In this example, the for loop iterates over the fruits list.

‚úã **During each iteration**, the variable fruit takes on the value of each element in the list ("apple", "banana", and "cherry" in sequence), and it prints each fruit.

You can also use the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers:

<br>

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

    # The for loop continues iterating until it has gone through all the elements in the sequence or until a break statement is encountered, which exits the loop prematurely.

# result
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

#### The for loop continues iterating until it has gone through all the elements in the sequence or until a break statement is encountered, which exits the loop prematurely.

<br>
<br>

### How can I use the `range()` for a real scenario?

<br>

- Let's imagine you're building a program that simulates a **Spotify** playlist, and you want to display the track numbers along with their titles.

- You can use the `range()` function to generate track numbers dynamically, especially if your playlist can have a variable number of tracks.

<br>

```python
playlist = ["Shape of You", "Despacito", "Uptown Funk", "See You Again", "Closer"]

print("My Spotify Playlist:")
for i in range(len(playlist)):
    print(f"{i+1}. {playlist[i]}")

```

<br>
<br>

```python
#
#

playlist = ["Shape of You", "Despacito", "Uptown Funk", "See You Again", "Closer"]

print("My Spotify Playlist:")
##
# len(playlist) returns the length of the playlist, which is the number of tracks.
#
# i iterates over each number generated by range(), representing the track number.

#
for i in range(len(playlist)):
    #
    #range(len(playlist)) generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to len(playlist) - 1. This sequence corresponds to the indices of the tracks in the playlist.
    #
    print(f"{i+1}. {playlist[i]}")
    #  playlist[i] accesses each track title using the current value of i.

    #  The f before a string literal in Python denotes an f-string, which is similar to template literals in JavaScript.
    #
# RESULT:
# My Spotify Playlist:
#1. Shape of You
# 2. Despacito
# 3. Uptown Funk
# 4. See You Again
# 5. Closer
#
```

- So, the loop iterates over each track in the playlist, printing the track number along with its title. The track numbers start from 1, hence the i+1 in the print statement.

<br>
<br>

### üëæ my question:

- is the `range()` used a lot or are there other ways to implement the spotify example, by other ways i mean in terms of "performance"

### chatgpt answer:

Depending on the specific requirements of your program, there are alternative methods you could consider for iterating over the playlist that might offer different trade-offs in terms of readability, performance, or simplicity.

<br>

Using `enumerate()`: Instead of using `range(len(playlist))`, you can use the **enumerate()** function, which returns both the index and the element from the iterable:

```python
playlist = ["Shape of You", "Despacito", "Uptown Funk", "See You Again", "Closer"]

print("My Spotify Playlist:")
#
#
for i, track in enumerate(playlist, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {track}")

```

<br>

- This approach is more Pythonic and often preferred because it's concise and clear.

<br>

Using a `for` loop directly on the list: In Python, you can loop directly over the elements of a list without explicitly using indices. This is simpler and often more readable:

```python
playlist = ["Shape of You", "Despacito", "Uptown Funk", "See You Again", "Closer"]

print("My Spotify Playlist:")
#
#
for track in playlist:
    #
    #
    print(track)

```

- If you don't need the track numbers, this method is preferable as it's more straightforward.

<br>

## transform or filter

#### Using a list comprehension:

- If you need to transform or filter the elements of the playlist, you might consider using a list comprehension:

```python

# ------ **
print('---- example range 4 ----')
#------- **
#
playlist = ["Shape of You", "Despacito", "Uptown Funk", "See You Again", "Closer"]

print("My Spotify Playlist:")
tracks_with_numbers = [f"{i+1}. {track}" for i, track in enumerate(playlist)]
for track_with_number in tracks_with_numbers:
    print(track_with_number)
# RESULT:
# My Spotify Playlist:
#1. Shape of You
# 2. Despacito
# 3. Uptown Funk
# 4. See You Again
# 5. Close
#
#
  #  The f before a string literal in Python denotes an f-string, which is similar to template literals in JavaScript.
```

- This approach can be more efficient if you're processing the entire playlist in one go, as list comprehensions are often faster than equivalent for loops.

<br>

### üü† In terms of performance, the differences between these methods are usually negligible unless you're working with very large datasets. Readability and maintainability should generally be prioritized over micro-optimizations unless performance is a critical concern.
