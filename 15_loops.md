## üü® [Loops](https://youtu.be/23vCap6iYSs?feature=shared&t=36)

- while loops

- for loops

### WHILE loop

- Just like in javascript

- careful with the never ending loop that will crash your browser, so dont **print** the below

```python
value = 1
while value < 10:
    print(value) # :stop_sign: DONT!!!

    #result
    # infinite loop
```

<br>
<br>

### Do this:

- add the `+= 1` its going to increment everytime it goes through the LOOP, until it reaches the 9 (as we are incrementing 1), which is the end point `< 10`

```python
value = 1
while value < 10:
    print(value)
    value += 1
#result
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
#It doesnt reach the 10, because the condition tells that "WHILE" its less than 10. if you want to show the 10, you can change the condition from < 10 to <= 10 (less or equal to 10)
value = 1
while value <= 10:
    print(value)
    value += 1
#result
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Another WAY to break the LOOP

```python
value = 1
while value <= 10:
    print(value)
    if value == 5:
        break #if the condition is met, it will stop the loop at 5
    value += 1
```

<br>

# ELSE

### üñêÔ∏è USING the else

- You can use it once the loop is completed and the condition is no longer TRUE

```python
while value <= 10:
  value += 1
  if value == 5:
     continue  # If value is 5, the loop skips the remaining code in this iteration and continues to the next iteration
  print(value)
  #
  # ELSE: You can use it once the loop is completed and the condition is no longer TRUE
  #
else:
    print("Value is now equal to " + value) #üßß ou will get an error if you try to print this, so convert the TYPE
    #
```
