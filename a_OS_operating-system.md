## 🟡 Operating system `OS`

- example

`from os.path import join`

### In Python, os is a module that provides a way to interact with the operating system.

<br>

🟤 It **includes functions** for:

- - **file** and **directory** manipulation,

- -  **environment variables**,

- and other **OS-related tasks**.

<br>
<br>

<br>

## 🟡 `os.path`

#### 🟠 When you see `from os.path import join`,

- - it **means** that you're **importing** the `join` **function** from the `os.path` **submodule**  <u>of the os module</u> .

<br>
<br>
<br>

### 🫐 to concatenate

#### The `join` function is used to `concatenate` <u>parts of a file path</u>  in a way that is platform-independent.

- - This means it will **use** the **correct path separators for the operating system you're running your code** on `(e.g., / for Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS, and \ for Windows)`.
