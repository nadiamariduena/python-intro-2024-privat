    # ---------- interesting
    # ðŸ”“ the @property here below, works as a lock on a box, when you use the lock to look inside the box, it shows you what is inside. the getter method works on the same way, it lets you see the value of something
    #
    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value

    @value.setter

    # :ðŸ”‘ the @value.setter, this @value from this setter here, is the key from the @property above, so when you say @value.setter, you are seeing: @property_name.setter

        # and here we can now change the old value from @property, to the new_value
        self._value = new_value
