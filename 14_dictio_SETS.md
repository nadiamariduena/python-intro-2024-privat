# SETS

- set is the final data collection I will talk about

<br>
<br>

### What are the SETS?

- A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.

- This means that sets don't allow duplicate elements, and they are not indexed.

- Sets are defined by enclosing comma-separated values inside curly braces {}.

## ðŸŸ  my question: If sets cannot be duplicated and are not indexed where can they be used? because in a real scenario I will need to change/modify or add NEW data very often
