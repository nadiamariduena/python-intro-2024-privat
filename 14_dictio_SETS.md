# SETS

- set is the final data collection I will talk about. Below you will see the chatgpt documentation about the topic and some exercises and also some of my questions about Ã­t

<br>
<br>

### What are the SETS?

- A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.

- This means that sets don't allow duplicate elements, and they are not indexed.

- Sets are defined by enclosing comma-separated values inside curly braces {}.

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  my question: If sets cannot be duplicated and are not indexed where can they be used? because in a real scenario I will need to change/modify or add NEW data very often

<br>

### ðŸŸ¡ chatgpt answer:

<br>

ðŸ”´ You're absolutely right! In scenarios where you need to continuously add more data or modify existing data, sets might not be the best choice.

<br>

- Sets are more **suitable** for situations where you have a **fixed collection of unique elements** that you want to perform set operations on, such as finding intersections or unions.

<br>

<br>

## EXAMPLE 1)

```python
# Creating an empty set
empty_set = set()
#
# Creating a set with elements

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#
# Adding elements to a set
my_set.add(6)
#
#
#  Removing elements from a set
my_set.remove(3)
```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ¨ Union of SETS

- The union of two sets consists of all unique elements present in either set.

<br>

#### In Python, you can use the `union()` method or the `|` operator to perform the union operation.

<br>

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1.union(set2)  # or union_set = set1 | set2
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

```

<br>

### ðŸŸ¨ Intersection of Sets (intersection_set):

- The intersection of two sets consists of all elements that are common to both sets.

<br>

- In Python, you can use the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator to perform the intersection operation.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)  # or intersection_set = set1 & set2
# Output: {3}

```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ¨ Difference of Sets (difference_set):

The difference between two sets consists of all elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set.

- In Python, you can use the `difference()` method or the `-` operator to perform the difference operation.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)  # or difference_set = set1 - set2
# Output: {1, 2}

```

## ðŸ‘¾ my QUESTION:

- But if there is an union of the 3 that is contained within the set1 and set2, isnt this going to destroy or modify the datas contained in the 3's?

#### Chatgpt Answer:

- You're correct. Performing the union of sets will merge the elements of both sets, but duplicates will not be added.

- If there are elements common to both sets, they will be present only once in the resulting union set. Let's illustrate this with an example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
set3 = {3, 6, 7}

# Union of sets
union_set = set1.union(set2, set3)
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

- In this example, the union of set1, set2, and set3 results in `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.` **Notice** that the element 3 appears only once in the union set, even though it's present in both set1, set2, and set3. This is because sets only contain unique elements, and duplicates are automatically removed.

âœ‹If you want to preserve the different data contained in all three sets separately, you should keep them separate and not perform a union operation. You can work with the individual sets as needed without merging them.

<br>

### ðŸ‘¾ my question:

- make a better example, lets add different data within each of the "3", and show me how it will look once the **"union"** is made. The 3 has to contain some real scenario data, lets say

```python
3: apple
3: potato
3: hammer
something like that but correctly done in set
```

#### chatgpt:

- Let's create sets with different data representing real scenarios, and then perform the union operation:

```python
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
set2 = {"orange", "pear", "grape"}
set3 = {"banana", "grape", "pineapple"}

# Union of sets
union_set = set1.union(set2, set3)

print("Union Set:", union_set)
#
# output
Union Set: {'grape', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple', 'pineapple', 'pear'}

```
