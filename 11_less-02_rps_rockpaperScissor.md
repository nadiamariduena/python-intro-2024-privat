## 2

```python
print("")
#\n ‚Äì newline
playerChoice = input("Enter...\n1 for Rock, \n2 for Paper, or \n3 for Scissors:\n\n")


#
#
if playerChoice < 1  | playerChoice > 3:
    # the problem with the below code is that its going to continue to execute, so we have to find a way to EXIT the program
    print("You ust enter 1, 2, or 3")

```

## YOu remember that on the previous tutorial, I imported the:

```javascript
 #
    # TO EXIT the program
    # sys.exit("You must enter 1, 2 , or 3")
```
