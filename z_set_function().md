- - **Purpose:** Creates a **list object** from an iterable. Unlike sets, lists can contain duplicate elements and maintain the order of elements.
tuple(iterable):

-  - **Purpose:** Creates a **tuple object** from an iterable. Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once created.
frozenset(iterable):

- - **Purpose:** Creates an **immutable version** of a set. Frozensets are hashable and can be used as dictionary keys or elements of other sets, but you cannot modify their contents after creation.
dict(iterable):

-  - **Purpose:** Creates a dictionary object from an iterable of key-value pairs.

-  - Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs and do not allow duplicate keys.
