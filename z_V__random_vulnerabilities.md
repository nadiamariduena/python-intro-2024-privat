## ðŸŸ¡ Vulnerabilities

<br>
<br>


### I received a vulnerability message while pushing data to my repository.

<br>

```javascript
// urllib3's Proxy-Authorization request header isn't stripped during cross-origin redirects Moderate
// #2 opened 3 days ago â€¢ Detected in urllib3 (pip) â€¢ LESSON_17_PYENV_venv_test/requirements.txt
```

<br>

- ðŸŸ  I'm currently learning about virtual environments **(venv)** in Python, and this project isn't critical.

- I believe this message could be due to two possible reasons: either the Python version I used to create the virtual environment is 3.10 and has bugs, or I didn't install the "requests" module correctly using the latest version of pip

### ðŸŸ¦ chatgpt

- It sounds like you've encountered a vulnerability message related to the **urllib3** library and its handling of the Proxy-Authorization request header during cross-origin redirects. This issue is categorized as "Moderate" severity.

<br>

### ðŸŸ§ why?

**Vulnerability Details:**


- The message indicates that there's an issue where the **Proxy-Authorization** header is not properly stripped during cross-origin redirects.

- This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the authorization credentials are unintentionally leaked or misused.

### ðŸŸ© Cause of the Issue:

- Python Version: While Python versions themselves might have bugs, vulnerabilities in libraries like **urllib3** are more specific to the library version rather than the Python version (3.10 in your case).

- It's more likely related to the library's implementation.

- **Dependency Management:** The issue might also arise if you haven't updated your dependencies properly.

- Sometimes, vulnerabilities are fixed in newer versions of libraries like urllib3, and updating your dependencies (such as requests) could help mitigate such issues.

```javascript
certifi==2024.7.4
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
idna==3.7
python-dotenv==1.0.1
requests==2.32.3
urllib3==2.2.2
