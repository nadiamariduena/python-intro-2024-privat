## ðŸŸ¡ Vulnerabilities

<br>
<br>


### I received a vulnerability message while pushing data to my repository.

<br>

```javascript
// urllib3's Proxy-Authorization request header isn't stripped during cross-origin redirects Moderate
// #2 opened 3 days ago â€¢ Detected in urllib3 (pip) â€¢ LESSON_17_PYENV_venv_test/requirements.txt
```

<br>

- ðŸŸ  I'm currently learning about virtual environments **(venv)** in Python, and this project isn't critical.

- I believe this message could be due to two possible reasons: either the Python version I used to create the virtual environment is 3.10 and has bugs, or I didn't install the "requests" module correctly using the latest version of pip

<br>


### ðŸŸ¦ chatgpt

- It sounds like you've encountered a vulnerability message related to the **urllib3** library and its handling of the Proxy-Authorization request header during cross-origin redirects. This issue is categorized as "Moderate" severity.

<br>



### Vulnerability Details:

- The message indicates that there's an issue where the **Proxy-Authorization** header is not properly stripped during cross-origin redirects.

- This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the authorization credentials are unintentionally leaked or misused.

<br>
<br>


### ðŸŸ© Cause of the Issue:

- Python Version: While Python versions themselves might have bugs, vulnerabilities in libraries like **urllib3** are more specific to the library version rather than the Python version (3.10 in your case).

- It's more likely related to the library's implementation.

- **Dependency Management:** The issue might also arise if you haven't updated your dependencies properly.

- Sometimes, vulnerabilities are fixed in newer versions of libraries like urllib3, and updating your dependencies (such as requests) could help mitigate such issues.

```javascript
// when you delete the venv with the cache, remove the requirements.txt also, check the python version you have within the interpreter and open the terminal with the + , dont split the terminal
// âœ‹
certifi==2024.7.4
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
idna==3.7
python-dotenv==1.0.1
requests==2.32.3
urllib3==2.2.2
//
//

certifi==2024.7.4
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
idna==3.7
python-dotenv==0.21.1
requests==2.31.0

// ðŸ¤¾
urllib3==2.0.7
```

### update

```javascript
pip install --upgrade urllib3

```

#### ðŸ”´ once you have updated or deleted the venv and re generated the venv and re installed the "requests" where this (urllib3) comes from

- you will have to go to the link that appears after you commit to your repo (https://github.com/yourgithub/yourfolderwheretheproblemcomesfrom/security/dependabot), once on the url of the issues, delete the issue related to what you just solved (only if you think you solved it)

## ðŸŸ£ REQUESTS

### ðŸ”´ Session object does not verify requests after making first request

#### chatgpt

- It seems like the error message you're encountering when pushing your repository is related to a security warning about using the requests library with verify=False. This warning is indicating that SSL certificate verification is disabled for requests made using verify=False, which can pose security risks, especially in production environments.



```javascript
Requests Session object does not verify requests after making first
request with verify=False Moderate
//
#1 opened 3 days ago â€¢ Detected in requests (pip) â€¢ LESSON_17_PYENV_venv_test/requirements.txt
```

<br>

### ðŸŸ© Understanding the Issue

<br>

When you use `verify=False` in your requests library calls, SSL certificate verification is disabled.

This means that the **HTTPS connections made by requests will not verify the authenticity of the server's SSL certificate**.

> ðŸ”´ This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept or manipulate the communication between your application and the server.


<br>


#### github


When making requests through a Requests Session, if the first request is made with verify=False to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of verify. This behavior will continue for the lifecycle of the connection in the connection pool.

### Remediation
Any of these options can be used to remediate the current issue, we highly recommend upgrading as the preferred mitigation.

**Upgrade to** `requests>=2.32.0.`

**For** `requests<2.32.0`, **avoid** setting `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session.


**For** `requests<2.32.0`, call **close()*** on Session objects to clear existing connections if verify=False is used.

```javascript
// âœ‹ what i had

requests==2.32.3

// ---------------
// after i removed the venv and re installed all the stuff related to venv

requests==2.31.0
```
