## ðŸŸ¡ Vulnerabilities

<br>
<br>


### I received a vulnerability message while pushing data to my repository.

<br>

```javascript
// urllib3's Proxy-Authorization request header isn't stripped during cross-origin redirects Moderate
// #2 opened 3 days ago â€¢ Detected in urllib3 (pip) â€¢ LESSON_17_PYENV_venv_test/requirements.txt
```

<br>

- ðŸŸ  I'm currently learning about virtual environments **(venv)** in Python, and this project isn't critical.

- I believe this message could be due to two possible reasons: either the Python version I used to create the virtual environment is 3.10 and has bugs, or I didn't install the "requests" module correctly using the latest version of pip
