### üç≠ What is a Closure?

by chatgpt

- A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing lexical scope, even when the function is called outside that scope. This means that the inner function remembers the environment in which it was created.

- Before seeing what a closure is, we have to first **understand** what **nested functions and non-local variables are**.

#### Nested functions in Python

- A function that is defined inside another function is known as a nested function. Nested functions are able to access variables of the enclosing scope.

```python
# Python program to illustrate
# nested functions
def outerFunction(text):

	def innerFunction():
		print(text)

	innerFunction()


if __name__ == '__main__':
	outerFunction('Hey!')
```

## Closure example:

```python
def outer_function(x):
    # This is the outer function

    def inner_function(y):
        # This is the inner function
        # It accesses the variable 'x' from the outer function
        return x + y

    # The outer function returns the inner function
    return inner_function

# Create a closure
closure = outer_function(10)

# Call the closure with an argument
result = closure(5)
print(result)  # Output: 15

```
