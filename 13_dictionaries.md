## Dictionaries

- Think of a dictionary in Python as a collection of key-value pairs. It's similar to how words and their meanings are organized in a real-world dictionary.

### 🟡 Here's a simple breakdown:

<br>

**Definition:** A dictionary is a mutable, unordered collection of items. Each item in a dictionary is a pair consisting of a key and a value.

<br>

**Creation:** You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` and separating each key-value pair with a colon `:`. For example:

```python
my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 7}

```

<br>

### Other ways

```python
#1
band ={

"vocals": "Plant",
"guitar": "Page"

}
print(band)
#
#
#2 or
band2 = dict(
vocals="Plant",
guitar="Page"
)

print(band2)
#
#
print(type(band))
#result: <class 'dict'>
print(len(band))
#result: 2
```

<br>

**Accessing Values:** You can access the value associated with a particular key by using square brackets `[]`. For example:

```python
#1
my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 7}
#
# 2
print(my_dict['apple'])  # Output: 5
```

<br>
<br>

### Other ways to access the data

```python
#
# ----- ACCESSing the data ---
# band ={

# "vocals": "Plant",
# "guitar": "Page"

# }
print(band["vocals"])
print(band.get("guitar"))
#result:
# 🐖 i get plant and page on the terminal, because these are the values that are aligned to the dictionary in line 27
# Plant
# Page
```

<br>
<br>

### what if i want to see all the keys

```python
#
#
# ----- print all keys ---

print(band.keys())
# result: dict_keys(['vocals', 'guitar'])
```

<br>

<br>

### 🟡 Adding or Modifying Items:

- You can add new items or modify existing ones in a dictionary by assigning a value to a **key**:

```python
#1
my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 7}
#
# 2
my_dict['grape'] = 4  # Adding a new item
my_dict['banana'] = 6  # Modifying an existing item
```

<br>
<br>

## Removing Items:

- You can remove items from a dictionary using the del keyword or the `pop()` method:

```python
#1
my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 7}
#
# 2
del my_dict['orange']  # Deleting a specific item
my_dict.pop('apple')   # Removing 'apple' and its value

```

<br>
<br>

### 🟡 Iterating Over a Dictionary:

- You can loop through a dictionary using a for loop. By default, **looping through a dictionary will give you its keys**:

```python
#
 my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 7}
#
#
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)  # This will print each key in the dictionary

```

<br>
<br>

## Checking for Key Existence: You can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the in keyword:

```python
#
 my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 7}
#
#
#
if 'apple' in my_dict:
    print("Yes, 'apple' is a key in the dictionary.")

```

<br>

### Dictionary Methods:

- Python dictionaries have several useful **methods** such as `keys(), values(), and items()` which return views of the dictionary's keys, values, and key-value pairs respectively.
