# üç≠ Recursion

- read the explanation below the code

```python
# check the explanation on 17 recursion
def add_one(num):
    if (num >= 9):
        return num + 1

    total = num + 1
    print(total)

    return add_one(total)

add_one(0)

#1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
```

<br>

# üü° Explanation

#### Imagine you have a number and you want to keep adding **1** to it until you reach a certain point. In this case, that point is **9**. Let's look at the code step by step:

<br><br>

### 1) Start with the number 0:

- You call the function add_one(0).

```python
add_one(0)
```

<br><br>

### 2) Check if the number is 9 or more:

- The first thing the function does is check if the number is 9 or more:

```python
if (num >= 9):
    return num + 1

```

#### üëæ If the number is 9 or more, the function stops and returns that number plus 1. But since we start with 0, this check is false and we move to the next part.üëæ

### üç∞ This is called "recursion." It means the function keeps calling itself with the new number until it meets a condition to stop.

- Let's see what happens step by step:

Step 1: **add_one(0)** adds 1 to 0 (total = 1) and calls add_one(1).

 <br>

Step 2: add_one(1) adds 1 to 1 (total = 2) and calls add_one(2).
Step 3: add_one(2) adds 1 to 2 (total = 3) and calls add_one(3).
Step 4: add_one(3) adds 1 to 3 (total = 4) and calls add_one(4).
Step 5: add_one(4) adds 1 to 4 (total = 5) and calls add_one(5).
Step 6: add_one(5) adds 1 to 5 (total = 6) and calls add_one(6).
Step 7: add_one(6) adds 1 to 6 (total = 7) and calls add_one(7).
Step 8: add_one(7) adds 1 to 7 (total = 8) and calls add_one(8).

<br>

Step 9: **add_one(8)** adds 1 to 8 (total = 9) and calls add_one(9).

<br>
<br>

### 3) Add 1 to the number and print it:

Next, the function adds 1 to the number and prints the new total:

```python

total = num + 1
print(total)
```

- So, for **add_one(0)**, it adds **1** to **0**, making **total 1**, and prints 1.

<br>
<br>

### 4) Call the function again with the new number:

- The function then calls itself with the new number:

```python
return add_one(total)

```

- üî¥ üî¥ This means it keeps going, adding 1 each time, until it reaches the point where the number is 9 or more.

<br>

- This is called "recursion." It means the function keeps calling itself with the new number until it meets the condition to stop.

### üü• So, the function only goes up to 9 because once it reaches 9, it stops and returns 10. It doesn't print 10 because it returns the value and doesn't continue to the print statement.

<br>
<br>

---

<br>

## üü° But what if i want to reach the 10?

<br>
<br>

```python
# check the explanation on 17 recursion
def add_one(num):
    if (num >= 9):
        return num + 1

    total = num + 1
    print(total)


    return add_one(total)

#add_one(0) // before the changes

# 1 here i will do some changes
mynewtotal = add_one(0)
print(mynewtotal)

#1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
```

<br>
<br>

## Explanation

### The Original Function

### 1) Start with the number 0:

- You call the machine with the number 0 using adds_one(0).

### 2) Check if the number is 9 or more:

##### The machine first checks if the number is 9 or more:

```python
if (num >= 9):
    return num + 1

```

<br>

> If the number is 9 or more, the machine stops and gives you the number plus 1.

<br>

### 3) üî¥ Add 1 to the number and print it:

> If the number is less than 9, the machine adds 1 to the number and prints it:

```python
total = num + 1
print(total)

```

- üî¥ So, if you start with 0, it becomes 1 and prints 1.

<br>

### 4) Call the machine again with the new number:

üëæ The machine then calls itself with the new number:

```python
return adds_one(total)
```

<br>

### üü† The New Part: Using the Machine and Getting the Result

Now, let‚Äôs look at the new lines you added:

```python
mynewtotal = adds_one(0)
print(mynewtotal)

```

<br>

### Start the process:

- You start the machine with the number 0 by calling adds_one(0).

### Run through the machine:

- The machine will add 1 to 0, print 1, and call itself with 1. It will keep doing this, printing each new number, until it gets to 9.

### Reaching 9:

- When the machine gets to 9, it will add 1 to 9, making it 10, and stop:

```python
if (num >= 9):
    return num + 1

```

<br>

-üî¥ So, adds_one(9) will return 10.

### Store the result:

The returned number 10 is stored in **mynewtotal:**

```python
mynewtotal = adds_one(0)

```

### Print the final result:

Finally, you print the value stored in mynewtotal:

```python
print(mynewtotal)

```

#### This will print 10.

<br>

## Summary

Here‚Äôs what happens step by step:

- The machine starts with 0 and prints 1.

- Then it calls itself with 1, prints 2, and so on.

- This continues until it prints 9.

- When it reaches 9, it adds 1 to get 10 and stops.

- The number 10 is saved in mynewtotal.

- Finally, mynewtotal (which is 10) is printed.

<br>

#### So, by adding those two new lines, you start the machine and then print the final result, which is 10. This way, you can see the final number the machine reaches after adding 1 repeatedly until it gets to 10.

```python
# Initialize the variables
value = True  # This means the loop should start and keep going as long as value is True
count = 0     # This starts our count at 0

# Start the loop
while value:
    # Inside the loop, we add 1 to count
    count += 1

    # Print the current count
    print(count)

    # Check if count is 5
    if count == 5:
        break  # If count is 5, we stop the loop

    else:
        value = 0  # This sets value to 0, which will stop the loop the next time it checks
        continue   # This tells the loop to go back to the start

```

<br>
<br>

## Explanation

### What Happens Step by Step

<br>

#### Initialize Variables:

- `value` is set to `True`, which means our loop will start running.

`count` is set to `0`.

<br>

## Start the Loop:

- Because `value` is set to `True`, the loop starts.

## First Loop Iteration:

- `count` is increased by 1, so `count` becomes `1`.

- it prints `1`.

- it checks if `count` is `5`. its not, so it goes to the `√®lse` part.

- in the `else` part, `value` is set to `0`

- `continue` tells the loop to go back to the start and check the condition again.

<br>
<br>

## üëæüëæ Lets Dissect it a bit more

- IGNORE the last 2 lines

```python
value = True  # Start with value set to True
count = 0     # Initialize count to 0

# Begin the loop
while value:
    count += 1       # Increase count by 1
    print(count)     # Print the current count

#
#
# üî¥ FOCUS ON THE BELOW: --------
    if count == 5:   # Check if count is 5
        break        # If count is 5, stop the loop
    # -------------------------
    #
    # OUTPUT:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

```

# EXPLANATION

### üü° Full Step-by-Step Execution

            First Iteration:
            count becomes 1
            Prints 1


            Second Iteration:

            count becomes 2
            Prints 2
            Third Iteration:

            count becomes 3
            Prints 3
            Fourth Iteration:

            count becomes 4
            Prints 4
            Fifth Iteration:

            count becomes 5
            Prints 5
            Breaks the loop because count is 5

<br>

üåà so that is why if i add this 2 lines below, to the **if** `from the moment the loop start, the value is no longer 0 and therefore is no longer true but false, so IT adds 1 like so (+= 1) and the total is 1`

```python
else:
         value = 0
         continue
```

### code

```python
# Initialize the variables
value = True  # This means the loop should start and keep going as long as value is True
count = 0     # This starts our count at 0

# Start the loop
while value:
    # Inside the loop, we add 1 to count
    count += 1

    # Print the current count
    print(count)

    # Check if count is 5
    if count == 5:
        break  # If count is 5, we stop the loop

    else:
        value = 0  # This sets value to 0, which will stop the loop the next time it checks
        continue   # This tells the loop to go back to the start

```

<br>
<br>

### I asked Chatgpt to give me a different type of example where i can use this loop

- Suppose you are building a simple script to simulate a music player that plays songs from a playlist. You want to simulate playing the first 5 songs in the playlist and print the title of each song as it plays.

```python
# Define a playlist with song titles
playlist = [
    "Song 1: Blinding Lights",
    "Song 2: Watermelon Sugar",
    "Song 3: Levitating",
    "Song 4: Peaches",
    "Song 5: Save Your Tears",
    "Song 6: Good 4 U",
    "Song 7: Kiss Me More"
]

# Initialize variables
value = True  # Control variable for the loop
count = 0     # Initialize count to 0

# Begin the loop to play songs
while value:
    count += 1       # Increase count by 1

    # Simulate playing the song by printing the title
    print(f"Playing {playlist[count - 1]}")

    if count == 5:   # Check if 5 songs have been played
        break        # If yes, stop the loop


```

#### output:

```python


Playing Song 1: Blinding Lights
Playing Song 2: Watermelon Sugar
Playing Song 3: Levitating
Playing Song 4: Peaches
Playing Song 5: Save Your Tears
```

## üç≠ Update the rock paper scissors

- Now I am going to update the game with the **function** I just learnt, don't forget to apply the indentation once you create the function.

<br>

- start by creating the function

```python
def play_rps():
```

- dont forget to call it at the bottom

```python
sys.exit("Bye! üëã")
play_rps()
```

<br>
<br>

### Add it here:

```python
#--------------
# BEFORE
#--------------
import sys
import random
from enum import Enum


class RPS(Enum):
    ROCK = 1
    PAPER = 2
    SCISSORS = 3


playagain = True

#
#
#--------------
# AFTER
#--------------
# üî¥ respect the indentation
#
import sys
import random
from enum import Enum



def play_rps():
    class RPS(Enum):
        ROCK = 1
        PAPER = 2
        SCISSORS = 3


    playagain = True

    while playagain:

```

<br>
<br>

## Replace the WHILE loop for the recursion

- first i will remove this

```python
 playagain = True

    while playagain:
```

<br>

- once removed, i will reverse the indentation with **tab key + shift**, if you notice after i removed the 2 lines i had an error, and even after the removal of 1 level of indentation i still have an error, but that is because the **continue** at the bottom

```python
import sys
import random
from enum import Enum

def play_rps():
    class RPS(Enum):
        ROCK = 1
        PAPER = 2
        SCISSORS = 3




    playerchoice = input(
        "\nEnter... \n1 for Rock,\n2 for Paper, or \n3 for Scissors:\n\n")

    player = int(playerchoice)

    if player < 1 or player > 3:
        sys.exit("You must enter 1, 2, or 3.")

    computerchoice = random.choice("123")

    computer = int(computerchoice)

    print("\nYou chose " + str(RPS(player)).replace('RPS.', '').title() + ".")
    print("Python chose " + str(RPS(computer)).replace('RPS.', '').title() + ".\n")

    if player == 1 and computer == 3:
        print("üéâ You win!")
    elif player == 2 and computer == 1:
        print("üéâ You win!")
    elif player == 3 and computer == 2:
        print("üéâ You win!")
    elif player == computer:
        print("üò≤ Tie game!")
    else:
        print("üêç Python wins!")

    playagain = input("\nPlay again? \nY for Yes or \nQ to Quit \n\n")


# üî¥ err here
    if playagain.lower() == "y":
        continue
    print("\nüéâüéâüéâüéâ")
    print("Thank you for playing!\n")
    playagain = False

sys.exit("Bye! üëã")

play_rps()
```
