# 🧶 Path `/` issue

#### When working with file paths in a Pygame project, the `path` you use to `load assets` like images depends on the directory structure of your project.

- - Initially, the teacher used a relative path with `../images/player.png`, but then **switched** to using `join('images', 'player.png')`.

#### 🍊 The success of these paths depends on where your script is located relative to the assets.

<br>

Here's a summary of the issue and solution based on different project structures:

### 🟤 Initial Path Example:

```python
player_surf = pygame.image.load('../images/player.png')

```

<br>

### 🟤 Alternative Path Example:

```python
player_surf = pygame.image.load(join('images', 'player.png'))
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### 🟤 Project Structure

```python
PROJECTFolder
   ├── images
   ├── audio
   └── game
       └── game.py

```



- - 🔴 In this structure, using `join('images', 'player.png')` **does not work** because `game.py` is **located** in the game **subfolder**, requiring a relative path ✋ **to move up one level** to **access the images folder**.

<br>

### Avoiding the `..` in Different Scenarios

If you want to avoid using `..`, you need to **make sure that your working directory is always set to PROJECTFolder when you run the script**.

This way, you can use relative paths based on the current working directory:

```python
import pygame
from os.path import join

# Define the path relative to the working directory (PROJECTFolder)
image_path = join('images', 'player.png')

# Load the image
player_surf = pygame.image.load(image_path)

```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🫐 Options

- If you're working on a project where the folder containing your assets is nested inside another project with many other games, you might be using a relative path like this:

🟠  Direct Path String (**EASY but not good**)

```python
player_surf = pygame.image.load('../images/player.png')
```

<br>

### 🔴 Issue with Using Relative Paths:


- This approach may work perfectly on your development machine, where the relative path `../images/player.png` correctly points to the image file.

 - - #### However, if you share your project with a colleague or deploy it on a different machine, the directory structure might differ.

 - - ✋ In such cases, the relative path may no longer be accurate, leading to broken image loads.

 - - #### 🔴 This can cause your game to crash or display missing assets if the expected path does not match the actual location of the files.

 <br>

 ### 🔴 Cross-Platform Issues:

 <br>

 The project may be developed on a Windows machine where paths use backslashes `(..\\images\\player.png)`, but **if it needs to be deployed on a Unix-based system (like macOS or Linux), the backslashes won’t work and will cause errors**.

 - - ✋ Hardcoding paths doesn’t account for platform-specific path separators.

 <br>

### 🔴 Version Control Conflicts:

<br>

 ✋ When working in a team, different members might use different folder structures or make changes that affect the paths.

 - - ✋ Hardcoded paths can lead to conflicts and confusion, as other team members might not have the same directory layout.

 #### This complicates collaboration and maintenance.

 <br>

### 🔴 Deployment Complexity:

<br>

**For deployment in different environments** (e.g., a **production server** or a packaged executable), hardcoded **paths might not be valid**.
