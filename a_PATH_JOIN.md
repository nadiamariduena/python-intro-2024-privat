# 🧶 Path `/` issue

#### When working with file paths in a Pygame project, the `path` you use to `load assets` like images depends on the directory structure of your project.

- - Initially, the teacher used a relative path with `../images/player.png`, but then **switched** to using `join('images', 'player.png')`.

#### 🍊 The success of these paths depends on where your script is located relative to the assets.
