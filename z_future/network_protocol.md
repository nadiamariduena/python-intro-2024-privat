### 👾 Network protocols


🟧 When looking for the definition and purpose of the **bitwise operators**  ➡️ [z_Bitwise_operator.md](../z_Bitwise_operator.md) , I found that they can be used in network protocols. Since I am just starting with Python and am not yet familiar with these concepts, I will save this information for future reference.

 Network protocols often use **bitwise** operations to manage and interpret data efficiently. One classic example is the TCP/IP protocol suite, particularly in the IP header and TCP flags. Let’s explore an example related to the TCP header flags to illustrate how bitwise operations are used
