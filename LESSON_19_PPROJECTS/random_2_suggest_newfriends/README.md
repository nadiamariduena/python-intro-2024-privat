## ðŸŸ¡ Random: Suggest new friends

- create a scenario where we use Python to implement a simplified version of suggesting new friends or people you may know on a **social media** platform like **Facebook**.

<br>

#### We'll have two files: `helper.py` and `main.py`.

<br>

### helper.py

- - In `helper.py`, we'll define a function that generates **random users** or profiles. This will simulate fetching potential friends or suggested connections.
