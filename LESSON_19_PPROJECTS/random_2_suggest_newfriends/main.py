# Create a scenario where we use Python to implement a simplified version of suggestion NEW FRIENDS


# If current_user_id is 1, then users[current_user_id - 1] means we're looking at the first user in the list (because computers start counting from 0, not 1).

# :ðŸŸ§ If the current user's ID is 2 (Mario), we want to ensure that Mario is excluded from the list of suggested friends. In programming, we typically start counting from 0 for the first element in a list, so users[current_user_id - 1] refers to the user at index current_user_id - 1 in the users list.
