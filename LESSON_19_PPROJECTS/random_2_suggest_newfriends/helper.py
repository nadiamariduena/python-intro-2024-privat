#suggest_random_user(current_user_id): This function takes current_user_id as a parameter and suggests a random user from users excluding the current user. It uses random.choice to select a random user from other_users, which are all users except the current one.
def suggest_random_user(current_user_id):
    #
    # Exclude the current user from suggestions

    other_users = [user for user in users if user["id"] != current_user_id]

   # If current_user_id is 1, then users[current_user_id - 1] means we're looking at the first user in the list (because computers start counting from 0, not 1).

    # :ğŸŸ§ If the current user's ID is 2 (Mario), we want to ensure that Mario is excluded from the list of suggested friends. In programming, we typically start counting from 0 for the first element in a list, so users[current_user_id - 1] refers to the user at index current_user_id - 1 in the users list.
