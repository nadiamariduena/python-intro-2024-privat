<br>
<br>

## I will be creating a simple setup for a game involving players.

  🔶 Imagine we’re talking about a game like **Tic-Tac-Toe** where players can be either people or computer characters.

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

## 🟣 QUESTION: create a diagram to visualize the O and X on the game


#### ✅ CHATGPT:

- -  **a diagram** is a great idea. Here’s a simple textual representation of the game board where you can see how **Xs** and **Os** are placed:


<br>

### 🟦 To visualize the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Xs and Os,


#### 🔶 Example 1: Initial Board


```bash
   1 | 2 | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | 9

```

<br>

- -   **1-9** are placeholders for where you can put **Xs and Os**.

- - You can **update the board** as **players** make their **moves**.

<br>


#### 🔶 Example 2: X and O Placed

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```

### How to Read the Board

https://www.vedantu.com/maths/rows-in-maths


**Rows:** The board is divided into three rows.

**Columns:** Each row has three columns.

**Cells:** The intersections of rows and columns are where you place Xs or Os


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

# 🟡 Let's Start

<br>
<br>





<br>

## 🟦 Within the `player.py`


- Start by importing the below




```python
import math
import random
```

<br>
<br>

## 🟦 Creating a `Player`:

<br>

- -  Create a **class:** `class Player:`


 - - #### Think of this as a blueprint for a player in the game.

 - - Each player has a special mark, like **X or O**.


<br>
<br>

```python
class Player:
    def __init__()
```

<br>
<br>

## 🟦 initialize it: `def __init__()`


- -  `__init__(self, letter)`: This is like setting up the player with their mark when they start the game.

- **For example**, if you choose X, then the player will be X.


<br>

- - ### `self.letter = letter`: (letter is X or O)

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```

<br>


- - ### 🟤 get_move(self, game)


- - `get_move(self, game)`: This is like a placeholder for where the **player will decide what move to make in the game**.

- -  Right **now**, it's **empty**, so the player doesn’t actually make a move yet.

<br>
<br>

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, letter):
        # letter is X or O
        self.letter = letter

    def get_move(self, game):
        pass


```


<br>
<br>

# 🟡 Child Classes and super()

- **When** you **create** a **child class**, you **often want** to **use the setup from the parent class**. This is where `super()` **comes in**.

<br>

### 🔶 What `super().`__init__(letter)` Does

- - **super():** This function is used to call methods from the parent class (Player in this case).


- - **super().__init__(letter)**: This calls the __init__ method of the Player class, passing the letter parameter to it.


<br>
<br>
<br>




### 🟠 `class RandomComputerPlayer` & `HumanPlayer`

#### When you use `super().__init__(letter)`, you are saying, “I want to use the setup that the Player class provides to initialize this new player, including setting up their mark (X or O).”


- It ensures that the **child classes** `(RandomComputerPlayer and HumanPlayer)` properly inherit and set up the letter attribute from the Player class.


<br>

```python
# child class
class RandomComputerPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, letter):
        super().__init__(letter)

    def get_move(self, game):
        pass



# ✋ Same here
#
class HumanPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, letter):
        super().__init__(letter)


    def get_move(self, game):
        pass
```


<br>

- - `class RandomComputerPlayer`: This is a special type of player who is a computer that makes random moves.


- - `super().__init__(letter)`: This line is like saying, “Hey, use the setup from the Player blueprint because I am still a player.”


- - `get_move(self, game)`: This is also a placeholder for where the computer would decide on a random move. For now, it’s empty.


<br>
<br>

## 🟤 Summary


**Parent Class (Player):** Defines the basic setup, including the letter attribute.

**Child Classes (RandomComputerPlayer and HumanPlayer):** Use super() to inherit and utilize the setup from the Player class.


`super().__init__(letter):` Ensures that the child classes correctly set up the letter attribute by calling the parent class’s __init__ method.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🟡 Create the `game.py`

```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]

        self.current_winner = None # Keep track of winner
```

<br>
<br>

### 🟧 `self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]`

<br>


- - 🔸 This line of code: `self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]` ,  **initializes** the <u>self.board</u>


- - 🔸 `for _ in range(9)`: This **iterates 9** times, and for each iteration, it adds a space to the list.


- - 🔸 Result: The list self.board will be `[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']`. This represents an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board with 9 positions, all initially empty.



<br>

- - ###  🔸 Think of it as a 3x3 grid but stored in a single line.


<br>
<br>

## 🟧  `self.current_winner = None`

<br>

**self.current_winner:** This keeps track of who is winning the game.

**None:** This means we don’t know yet if anyone has won because the game hasn’t been played.

<br>
<br>

---

<br>
<br>

## 🌴 Create a another function, call it:  `print_board`

- pass the param from the parent function: **self**

```python
def print_board(self):
    #This part creates a list of rows from the board. Let’s break this down:
    #- - self.board: This is the list with all the spaces on the board.
    for row in [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]:
```

<br>
<br>

## 🟩  Let’s break this down:



### 🟠 `for row in [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]`:

<br>

- 🌈 **Imagine** we have a tic-tac-toe board represented as a list with 9 positions, like this:

```python
self.board = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

```

#### This list represents the tic-tac-toe board like this:

```bash
   0 | 1 | 2
  ---|---|---
   3 | 4 | 5
  ---|---|---
   6 | 7 | 8

```


<br>
<br>

### `for row in`:

- - `for` row `in` ...: This part **tells** the **computer** to **go through each** <u>row</u>  **one by one**.

- - ##### It’s like saying, “For each row in the list we’re making, do something with it.”


<br>
<br>


### `[self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]`:

- - This part creates a list of rows from the **board.**

- - **self.board:** This **is** the **list** with **all** the **spaces** on the **board**.


<br>
<br>

## 🟨 What Does `i*3:(i+1)*3` Do?

<br>

🟦 `i*3`: This tells us where to **start** in the list for each row.

🟦 `(i+1)*3`: This tells us where to **stop** in the list for each row.


<br>

#### Understanding i*3

- In this Tic-Tac-Toe game, the list of numbers is divided into three rows.

<br>
<br>

 ![https://youtu.be/LgR6UNeQxXE?feature=shared](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8fbc564-6920-42a4-b72a-66b0f6fc024c)

<br>

### 🌈 short explanation:

### Imagine you’re at a funfair with a carousel that has 3 sections. Each section has different animals to ride on. You get to choose one animal from each section as the carousel spins.

- 🎠 Carousel Machine = Loop: Just like the carousel machine spins through different animal seats, the loop goes through different rows.

- 🎠 Each Turn = Each Iteration: Each turn of the carousel machine moves you to a new set of animal seats, just like each iteration of the loop moves to the next row. 🎠


<br>

- The for row in [...] loop iterates over:



```bash
   0 | 1 | 2
  ---|---|---
   3 | 4 | 5
  ---|---|---
   6 | 7 | 8

```

## or

[ 🐴 | 🦄 | 🐪 ]

[ 🦓 | 🦒 | 🦁 ]

[ 🐯 | 🐵 | 🦔 ]

#### Each section represents a different part of the carousel 🎠 . Think of these sections like the rows in our Tic-Tac-Toe game

- - Imagine you’re at a **funfair** 🎪 with a carousel 🎠 that has 3 sections.

- - Each section has different animals to ride on. You get to choose one animal 🦓 from each section as the carousel spins .

<br>


<br>

### 🍭 When i is 0:

- -  `i*3` is `0*3`, which equals `0`.

- - This means **we start at position `0`** in the **list**.

<br>

### 🎠 How it works, imagine a iteration, like a carousel SPIN, each turn is similar to a loop iteration

<br>


#### First Round (First Turn):

```bash
Round 1:
[ 🐴 | 🦄 | 🐪 ]


# - You start at the first section.
# - Pick an animal from this section.
# - Example: You choose the 🐴 from the first section.
```
#### Second Round (Second Turn):

```bash
Round 2:
[ 🦓 | 🦒 | 🦁 ]
# - Carousel turns to the second section.
# - Pick an animal from this new section.
# - Example: You choose the 🦓 from the second section.
```
#### Third Round (Third Turn):

```bash
Round 3:
[ 🐯 | 🐵 | 🦔 ]

# - Carousel turns to the third section.
# - Pick an animal from this last section.
# - Example: You choose the 🐯 from the third section.
```

<br>
<br>

```python
Tic-Tac-Toe Grid:

🍭
1. **First Iteration (i = 0)**
   - Start at index: 0
   - End at index: 3
   - Extract: [0, 1, 2]

   [0 | 1 | 2]  <- First Row (0 to 2)

🍰
2. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**
   - Start at index: 3
   - End at index: 6
   - Extract: [3, 4, 5]

   [3 | 4 | 5]  <- Second Row (3 to 5)

🍓
3. **Third Iteration (i = 2)**
   - Start at index: 6
   - End at index: 9
   - Extract: [6, 7, 8]

   [6 | 7 | 8]  <- Third Row (6 to 8)

```
<br>

#### and opla.. jump to the next row

![tumblr_f7a8d8b69cdcc60f31cb097c3a334d5f_82b2b893_500](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1a09d4d-7946-4d44-8765-8b700a3a5280)


<br>

### Visual Explanation

- The **for** row **in** [...] loop iterates over:



```bash
| 0 | 1 | 2 |  <- First Row (0 to 2)
| 3 | 4 | 5 |  <- Second Row (3 to 5)
| 6 | 7 | 8 |  <- Third Row (6 to 8)
```



<br>

## `for row in [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]:`


## 🟠 What i+1 Does 🟡

`i+1` helps us figure out the end position of the slice.


```bash
i represents the current row index.

i + 1 gives you the next row’s index, which helps determine the end of the current row.
```
<br>

#### 🟣 in other words: `i + 1` gives you the next row’s index, which helps determine the end of the current row.

```bash
For i = 0: (0+1)*3 = 3 which gives us the end index 3.
For i = 1: (1+1)*3 = 6 which gives us the end index 6.
For i = 2: (2+1)*3 = 9 which gives us the end index 9.
```



### 🟣 In other words: when the first round (or spin) of the carousel ends, it slices at position 3, which marks the end of the first row and the beginning of the second row.

```python
# (i+1) or (0+1)
For i = 0: (0+1)*3 = 3 which gives us the end index 3.
```
<br>

### As the carousel continues to spin, the visible rows are updated, but this movement is not shown in the slice. The slicing expression [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3]] dynamically adjusts to extract each row based on the current iteration.

```python
For i = 1: (1+1)*3 = 6 which gives us the end index 6.
# AND so on
```
<br>
<br>

### Expanding to a Grid with 4 Values Per Row


- - If you change the slicing formula to `[self.board[i*4:(i+1)*4]]`, this will create a grid where each row contains 4 values:

```bash
| 🐴 | 🦄 | 🐪 | 🦓 |  <- First Row (positions 0 to 3)
| 🦒 | 🦁 | 🐯 | 🐵 |  <- Second Row (positions 4 to 7)
| 🦔 | 🦋 | 🦜 | 🦨 |  <- Third Row (positions 8 to 11)
```


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🟡 Connection and Purpose

<br>

- - **Initialization**

`self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]`:

>This creates the board with 9 empty spaces, setting up the initial state of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

<br>

- -  **Row Extraction**

`for row in [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]:`

>This takes the linear list self.board and splits it into 3 rows, each containing 3 elements. It makes it easier to print the board in a 3x3 grid format.

<br>

### 🟫 Consider the board after some moves might look like this:

```python
self.board = ['X', 'O', 'X', ' ', 'X', 'O', ' ', ' ', 'O']

```



### The list comprehension inside print_board:

```python
[self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]
```

<br>

#### Another example

```python
i=0: self.board[0:3] gives ['X', ' ', 'O'] (Row 0).
i=1: self.board[3:6] gives [' ', 'X', ' '] (Row 1).
i=2: self.board[6:9] gives ['O', ' ', 'X'] (Row 2).
```




<br>




<br>
<br>

## 🟡 Add the bars to the table


<br>

- -  `' | '.join(row)` joins the elements of the row with `' | '` as the separator, so each row’s elements are separated by vertical bars.

<br>

- - `'| ' + ... + ' |'` wraps the formatted row with | on both ends.

<br>

> #### This format makes it easy to *visually* inspect the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board, with each cell separated by vertical bars and each row clearly delineated.


```python
print('| ' +  ' | '.join(row) +  ' |')
```
#### output

```bash
| X | O | X |
|   | X | O |
|   |   | O |
```

<br>


```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self):

        self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)]
        self.current_winner = None

    def print_board(self):

         for row in [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]:
             #
             #  | '.join(row) joins the elements of the row with ' | ' as the separator, so each row’s elements are separated by vertical bars.
             print('| ' +  ' | '.join(row) +  ' |')
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🟡 `@staticmethod`

### 🫐 What is `@staticmethod`?

<br>

####  A staticmethod in Python is a 🔸  *method decorator*.



🍊 It is **used** to **define a method** in a **class** that **does not require access** to the **instance** (`self`) or the class (`cls`) to which it belongs (*check the examples in the link below*).

####  🧶 [READ MORE: z_decorators](../../../z_decorators.md)



<br>
<br>

## 🟦 Creating the Double Grid

### 🍊 This line Below creates a grid with numbered positions (0 to 8) for players to choose where to place their X or O.


#### `number_board = [[str(i) for i in range(j*3, (j+1)*3)] for j in range(3)]`


**Players Choose a Position by Number:** For example, if a player wants to place their `X` in the middle of the board, they would choose position 4.

<br>

#### Before move

```bash
number_board = [
    ['0', '1', '2'],  # Row j = 0
    ['3', '4', '5'],  # Row j = 1
    ['6', '7', '8']   # Row j = 2
]

```

- - This number_board is used to show the positions on the Tic-Tac-Toe board to help players select where  they want to place their X or O.

#### After player places X in position 4:



```bash
| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | X | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |

```
<br>

## 🚀 Recapitulative

- so to be clear: the 9 boxes are **indexes**

- Each of the **9 cells** is indexed from `0 to 8`.

- These indices represent the positions in  the board.

- - #### 👾 so when user adds `X` to index `4` (dot orange), its seeing as J4 in i4, just like in chess board visual (not the logic)

```python
| 0 |  1 | 2 |  <- First Row (0 to 2)
| 3 |🔸4 | 5 |  <- Second Row (3 to 5)
| 6 |  7 | 8 |  <- Third Row (6 to 8)
```

- - **Index 4:** In the 1D list, it is the fifth position, corresponding to the center of the grid.

- - **Grid View:** You would see it as J4 in the i4 position, indicating where the move was made.

<br>

<br>
<br>

## 🌈 Breaking It Down

`for j in range(3)` :  This part is a **loop** that **runs 3 times**.

- - **Each time**, `j` takes on a value of 0, 1, and 2, one at a time.

- - #### Think of `j` as the row number in the grid.

<br>


### 🟠 Inner List Comprehension `[[str(i) for i in range(j*3, (j+1)*3)] for j in range(3)]`:


<br>

>- - **For each** value of `j`, 🤺 this part creates a list of numbers.

>- - **It starts** at `j*3` and **goes up to** `(j+1)*3`, but doesn’t include `j+1)*3`.


<br>
<br>

### 🟡 The logic used in the previous for loop in the `print_board()` function is similar, but now it’s applied to track and display the player's moves instead of just printing the board layout.🤺

- Based on the previous `For` LOOP:  `j + 1` gives you the next row’s index (where the orange🔸 dot is, means that the index of the second row is the 3, 3 is the current index, and it marks the end of the ), which helps determine the end of the current row.

```bash
| 0 | 1 | 2 |  <- First Row (0 to 2)
|3🔸| 4 | 5 |  <- Second Row (3 to 5)
|6🔸 | 7 | 8 |  <- Third Row (6 to 8)
```

```python
For i = 0: (0+1)*3 = 3 which gives us the end index 3.
For i = 1: (1+1)*3 = 6 which gives us the end index 6.
For i = 2: (2+1)*3 = 9 which gives us the end index 9.
```


<br>
<br>

### Before continuing with the `available moves`, this is what i have until now:

<br>

```python
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self):

        self.board = [' ' for _ in range(9)] #
        self.current_winner = None #

    def print_board(self):

         for row in [self.board[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]:
             print('| ' +  ' | '.join(row) +  ' |')

    @staticmethod
    def print_board_nums():
        number_board = [[str(i) for i in range(j*3, (j+1)*3)] for j in range(3)]

        for row in number_board:
            print('| ' + '| '.join(row) + ' |')

```

<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>

## 🟧 `Available Moves`

### This function helps us find out which boxes are still free to make a move in the game.


```python
def available_moves(self):
```


<br>
<br>

### 🟦 After you've played with some of the boxes, this function will check which ones are left for you to use.


```python

    def available_moves(self):

        moves = []

        for (i, spot) in enumerate(self.board):

            if spot == ' ':
                moves.append(i)

        return

```


<br>
<br>


### 1. 🔶 Creating a List for Moves:

Here, you **create an empty**  <u>list</u> **called moves**.

```python
moves = []
```

- - This list will store the positions on the board where a move can be made.

<br>


#### 2. 🔶 Looping Through the Board:

### ENUMERATE()

```python
 for (i, spot) in enumerate(self.board):
```

-  `enumerate()`: will help you to loop through items that dont have an assigned id, like "id": 0, "id": 1, its for values such as [ apple, fruits, etc,]

<br>


#### 3. 🔶 Checking if the Spot is Empty

```python
if spot == ' ':
```

<br>
<br>

#### 4. 🔶 Adding Empty Spots to the List:

```python
 moves.append(i)
```

- - **If** the **spot is empty**, this line adds the position i to the moves list. This way, you keep track of where players can make a move.

<br>
<br>

#### 5. 🔶 return the func

```python
return
```

- -  Finally, the function returns the moves list, which now contains all the positions on the board where a player can put their mark.

<br>
<br>



```python

    def available_moves(self):

        moves = []

        for (i, spot) in enumerate(self.board):

            if spot == ' ':
                moves.append(i)

        return

```


### 🟧 Example

Let’s say your board looks like this:

```python
X | * | O
---------
* | X | *
---------
🔸| * | O

```

<br>

### 👾 Explanation with enumerate

<br>

- - **Index 0:** The spot is **X** (not empty).

- - So, index 0 is not added to the moves list.


<br>

**Index 1:** The spot is * (empty). So, index 1 is added to the moves list.

**Index 2:** The spot is O (not empty). So, index 2 is not added to the moves list.

**Index 3:** The spot is * (empty). So, index 3 is added to the moves list.

**Index 4:** The spot is X (not empty). So, index 4 is not added to the moves list.

**Index 5:** The spot is * (empty). So, index 5 is added to the moves list.

**Index 6:** The spot is * (empty). So, index 6 is added to the moves list.

**Index 7:** The spot is * (empty). So, index 7 is added to the moves list.

**Index 8:** The spot is O (not empty). So, index 8 is not added to the moves list.

<br>

### 🟧 Result

<br>

The `available_moves` function will `return [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]`, indicating the positions on the board where a player can make a move.


<br>
<br>

### A cleaner way of doing this:

```python
# ---- OPtion A
def available_moves(self):
        moves = []
        for (i, spot) in enumerate(self.board):
            if spot == ' ':
                moves.append(i)
        return

# ---- OPtion B
# cleaner
#
return [i for i, spot in enumerate(self.board) if spot == ' ']

```

<br>
<br>

## 🟡`return [i for i, spot in enumerate(self.board) if spot == ' ']`



- - #### 🍊 This line finds all the empty spaces on the board where a player can put their mark. It looks at each spot on the board and checks if it's empty. If it is, it remembers the position so the player knows where they can move.


<br>

## 🫐 `i for i`

🔴 "It's **like** saying, 'I want to create a new list 👭 by copying certain spots from the original list (the first i list).

- - I will look at each spot in the original list, check if it is empty (what I mean by spot in this game), and if it is, I’ll add that spot to the new list (the second i list).'"

```python
#
i for i,
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

 ### 🟠 Modify this function

```python
  # ---- before ----
  def get_move(self, game):
        pass # hold pn for now

  # ---- after ----

  def get_move(self, game):

## 🍍 Computer Move

### 🟧 Computer Player that picks its move randomly.

```python
    def get_move(self, game):
        # Getting a Move: Chooses a random empty position from
        # the board for the computer’s move.
         #
        #picks a random position from that list of available moves.
        square = random.choice(game.available_moves())
        return square
        # The method returns this random position (square), which tells the game
        # where the computer player wants to place its mark.


```

## 🍍 Human Move

### 🟧  The Human Player

- -  the Human Player, it’s a bit like the game is saying, “I’m not letting you move until you pick a spot that’s actually free!”


```python

#🤚 HUMAN move
class HumanPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, letter):
        super().__init__(letter)

    #Human Player is asked to choose a spot to put their mark, and the game will keep
    def get_move(self, game):

       valid_square = False
       #Start with No Move: It starts with valid_square = False which means it hasn’t found a good move yet.


       val = None
       #val = None, just means there’s no move chosen yet.

       while not valid_square:

           #Ask for Input: The game will ask the player to type in their move. For example,
           # it might ask, "Where do you want to place your mark? (Pick a number from 0 to 9)."
           square = input(self.letter + '\'s turn. Input move (0-9):')
```

## 🔴 `Try & exception`

### In the try block...

- - the **function converts the user input** to an **integer** and **checks if** this **integer** is a **valid move** by ensuring it's in the list of available moves.

<br>

- - **If the integer** is **not** in the **list** or the conversion fails, it raises a **ValueError**, which prompts the except block to ask the user to enter a valid move. If the input is valid, it sets valid_square to True and completes the input process.

<br>

```python
    try:
            val = int(square)
            if val not in game.available_moves():
                    raise ValueError
            valid_square = True


    except ValueError:
                print(' Invalid square. Try again')

return val
```

### 🎠 🌈  Imagine you’re playing Tic-Tac-Toe and you pick a spot.

>The game then **checks if it’s a good choice**—like **making sure** you **picked a valid box**.

> - - **If your pick is wrong**, the game tells you to try again, like a friend helping you get the right answer.

> - - When you finally choose a good spot, the game lets you place your mark and everyone’s happy!
