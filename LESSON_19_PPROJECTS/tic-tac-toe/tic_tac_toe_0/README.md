# 🟡 Tic Tac Toe


<br>
<br>

## I will be creating a simple setup for a game involving players.

  🔶 Imagine we’re talking about a game like **Tic-Tac-Toe** where players can be either people or computer characters.

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

## 🟣 QUESTION: create a diagram to visualize the O and X on the game


#### ✅ CHATGPT:

- -  **a diagram** is a great idea. Here’s a simple textual representation of the game board where you can see how **Xs** and **Os** are placed:


<br>

### 🟦 To visualize the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Xs and Os,


#### 🔶 Example 1: Initial Board


```bash
   1 | 2 | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | 9

```

<br>

- -   **1-9** are placeholders for where you can put **Xs and Os**.

- - You can **update the board** as **players** make their **moves**.

<br>


#### 🔶 Example 2: X and O Placed

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```

### How to Read the Board

**Rows:** The board is divided into three rows.

**Columns:** Each row has three columns.

**Cells:** The intersections of rows and columns are where you place Xs or Os
