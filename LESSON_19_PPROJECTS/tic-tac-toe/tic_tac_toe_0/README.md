# ðŸŸ¡ Tic Tac Toe


<br>
<br>

## I will be creating a simple setup for a game involving players.

  ðŸ”¶ Imagine weâ€™re talking about a game like **Tic-Tac-Toe** where players can be either people or computer characters.

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

## ðŸŸ£ QUESTION: create a diagram to visualize the O and X on the game


#### âœ… CHATGPT:

- -  **a diagram** is a great idea. Hereâ€™s a simple textual representation of the game board where you can see how **Xs** and **Os** are placed:


<br>

### ðŸŸ¦ To visualize the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Xs and Os,


#### ðŸ”¶ Example 1: Initial Board


```bash
   1 | 2 | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | 9

```

<br>

- -   **1-9** are placeholders for where you can put **Xs and Os**.

- - You can **update the board** as **players** make their **moves**.

<br>


#### ðŸ”¶ Example 2: X and O Placed

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```

### How to Read the Board

**Rows:** The board is divided into three rows.

**Columns:** Each row has three columns.

**Cells:** The intersections of rows and columns are where you place Xs or Os

# ðŸŸ¡ Let's Start

<br>
<br>





<br>

## ðŸŸ¦ Within the `player.py`


- Start by importing the below




```python
import math
import random
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ¦ Creating a `Player`:

<br>

- -  Create a **class:** `class Player:`


 - - #### Think of this as a blueprint for a player in the game.

 - - Each player has a special mark, like **X or O**.


<br>
<br>

```python
class Player:
    def __init__()
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ¦ initialize it: `def __init__()`


- -  `__init__(self, letter)`: This is like setting up the player with their mark when they start the game.

- **For example**, if you choose X, then the player will be X.


<br>

- - ### `self.letter = letter`: (letter is X or O)

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```

<br>
<br>


## ðŸŸ¦ get_move(self, game)


- - `get_move(self, game)`: This is like a placeholder for where the **player will decide what move to make in the game**.

- -  Right **now**, it's **empty**, so the player doesnâ€™t actually make a move yet.
