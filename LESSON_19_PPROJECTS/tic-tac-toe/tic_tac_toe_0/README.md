<br>

## I will be creating a simple setup for a game involving players.

  ðŸ”¶ Imagine weâ€™re talking about a game like **Tic-Tac-Toe** where players can be either people or computer characters.

```bash
   X | O | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | X | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | O

```
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

## ðŸŸ£ QUESTION: create a diagram to visualize the O and X on the game


#### âœ… CHATGPT:

- -  **a diagram** is a great idea. Hereâ€™s a simple textual representation of the game board where you can see how **Xs** and **Os** are placed:


<br>

### ðŸŸ¦ To visualize the game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Xs and Os,


#### ðŸ”¶ Example 1: Initial Board


```bash
   1 | 2 | 3
  ---|---|---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---|---|---
   7 | 8 | 9

```

<br>

- -   **1-9** are placeholders for where you can put **Xs and Os**.

- - You can **update the board** as **players** make their **moves**.
