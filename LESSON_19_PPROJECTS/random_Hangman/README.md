### ðŸŸ¦ Structure

```javascript
project_folder/
     â””â”€â”€ file_withwords.py
     â””â”€â”€ helper.py
     â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

<br>

## Explanation

- You can explain this by using an analogy of picking toys from a box. Initially, you pick a toy (**first** `random.choice(words)`), but **if the ðŸ§¸ toy has a mark** or is **broken** ðŸ§¶ *(like a word with underscores or spaces)*, you **put it back** and **pick another** toy ðŸ§¸ (**second** `random.choice(words)`) **until you find a toy** (word) that's perfect (no marks or broken parts).

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ   0. import

- import the **random** module, then import the file with the words

```python
import random
from file_withwords import words
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  1. Retrieve the `words` from the `file_withwords`

- pass the parameter **words**

```python
def get_valid_word(words):
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  2. Initialization:

####  Retrieve the words from the `file_withwords.py`

-  - This is the first random selection which picks a word to start with.

<br>

```python
#1
def get_valid_word():
    #
    # ðŸ”¸ Initialization:
    #  This is the first random selection which picks a word to start with.
    word = random.choice(words)


```


<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  3.  Validation Loop:

####  - The while loop checks the selected word (word) to ensure it does not contain underscores ('_') or spaces (' ').

<br>


- -  `while _ or space ''` **is in the word**,  **keep choosing a word** (If the selected word contains either an underscore or a space, the loop continues to randomly select another word from words until a valid word (without underscores or spaces) is found.)


<br>

```python
  # ðŸ”¸ Validation Loop

    while '_' in word or ' ' in words:
```
<br>

<br>

## ðŸŸ  4.  Second `random.choice(words)`:

### Second Random Selection (random.choice(words) within the loop):

<br>

- - Inside the while loop, when word is found to contain an underscore or a space, random.choice(words) is used again to pick another random word from the list words.

<br>

- - ðŸ§¶  This process repeats until a word is selected that meets the condition of not containing underscores or spaces.


```python
word = random.choice(words)
```

<br>

<br>

## ðŸŸ  5.  `return word`:

### Once a valid word (one that does not contain underscores or spaces) is found, the function returns this word.


```python
return word
```


<br>

<br>

 ### ðŸŸ¡ 6. Select a random word from the words list

<br>

- This function selects a random word from the words list, **ensuring** it **doesn't contain hyphens or spaces**.


- - ðŸ”¶ If a word with these characters is chosen, it keeps selecting until it finds a valid word.

<br>

```python
def get_valid_word(words):
    word = random.choice(words)
    while '-' in word or ' ' in word:
        word = random.choice(words)
    return word

```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


 ### ðŸŸ¡ 7.


 -  Import `string` ,  to **access** the uppercase **alphabet**



```python
import random
from file_withwords import words
import string âœ‹ # import this
#
```
<br>
<br>

 ### ðŸŸ¡ 8. Initialize the Game:

 -  - ðŸŸ  It selects a valid word for the game, initializes the sets for the letters in the word, the alphabet, and used letters.

 - - #### ðŸŸ¦ Purpose:

 <br>

 - - **Checks** if the **guess** is **valid and unused**.

- - **Updates** the **state** based on **whether** the **guess** is **correct or not**.

- - **Provides feedback** to the **user** if the **guess** has **already** been **used or is invalid**


<br>


```python
def hangman():
    word = get_valid_word(words) # the get_valid_word is the first function. the ones that handles (selects a random word from the words list, **ensuring** it **doesn't contain hyphens or spaces**.)


    #
    #
    word_letters = set(word) #`word_letters` is a `set` of **unique letters** in the `word` to be **guessed**
    alphabet = set(string.ascii_uppercase) #`alphabet` is a `set` **of all uppercase letters**.
    used_letters = set() #`used_letters` keeps **track of letters** that the **user has guessed** so far.

```

<br>

 - - ðŸŸ¢ `word` is `set` to a valid **random word**.

 - - ðŸŸ¢ `word_letters` is a `set` of **unique letters** in the `word` to be **guessed**.


 - - ðŸŸ¢ `alphabet` is a `set` **of all uppercase letters**.


 - - ðŸŸ¢ `used_letters` keeps **track of letters** that the **user has guessed** so far.



<br>
<br>

 ### ðŸŸ¡ 9. Prompts the user to guess a letter

- Prompts the user to guess a letter and converts their input to uppercase for consistency with the game logic.

 <br>

```python
user_letter = input("Guess a letter: ").upper()
```


<br>
<br>


 ### ðŸŸ¡ 10. Handle User Input: Prompts the user to guess a letter and processes the guess:


<br>



```python

# If it is, add it to used_letters.
    if user_letter in alphabet - used_letters:
        used_letters.add(user_letter)

        if user_letter in word_letters: # If the letter is in word_letters,
            word_letters.remove(user_letter) # it means the guess was correct, so remove it from word_letters.

```

<br>
<br>


### ðŸŸ   at this point

- You can use the **INPUT**: `input()`

- But You won't receive any error messages at this stage; those will be addressed in the **next phase**.
