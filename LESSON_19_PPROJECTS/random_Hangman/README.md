### ðŸŸ¦ Structure

```javascript
project_folder/
     â””â”€â”€ file_withwords.py
     â””â”€â”€ helper.py
     â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

<br>

## Explanation

- You can explain this by using an analogy of picking toys from a box. Initially, you pick a toy (**first** `random.choice(words)`), but **if the ðŸ§¸ toy has a mark** or is **broken** ðŸ§¶ *(like a word with underscores or spaces)*, you **put it back** and **pick another** toy ðŸ§¸ (**second** `random.choice(words)`) **until you find a toy** (word) that's perfect (no marks or broken parts).

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ   0. import

- import the **random** module, then import the file with the words

```python
import random
from file_withwords import words
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  1. Retrieve the `words` from the `file_withwords`

- pass the parameter **words**

```python
def get_valid_word(words):
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  2. Initialization:

####  Retrieve the words from the `file_withwords.py`

-  - This is the first random selection which picks a word to start with.

<br>

```python
#1
def get_valid_word():
    #
    # ðŸ”¸ Initialization:
    #  This is the first random selection which picks a word to start with.
    word = random.choice(words)


```


<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  3.  Validation Loop:

####  - The while loop checks the selected word (word) to ensure it does not contain underscores ('_') or spaces (' ').

<br>


- -  `while _ or space ''` **is in the word**,  **keep choosing a word** (If the selected word contains either an underscore or a space, the loop continues to randomly select another word from words until a valid word (without underscores or spaces) is found.)


<br>

```python
  # ðŸ”¸ Validation Loop

    while '_' in word or ' ' in words:
```
<br>

<br>

## ðŸŸ  4.  Second `random.choice(words)`:

### Second Random Selection (random.choice(words) within the loop):

<br>

- - Inside the while loop, when word is found to contain an underscore or a space, random.choice(words) is used again to pick another random word from the list words.

<br>

- - ðŸ§¶  This process repeats until a word is selected that meets the condition of not containing underscores or spaces.


```python
word = random.choice(words)
```

<br>

<br>

## ðŸŸ  5.  `return word`:

### Once a valid word (one that does not contain underscores or spaces) is found, the function returns this word.


```python
return word
```


<br>

<br>

 ### ðŸŸ¡ 6. Select a random word from the words list

<br>

- This function selects a random word from the words list, **ensuring** it **doesn't contain hyphens or spaces**.


- - ðŸ”¶ If a word with these characters is chosen, it keeps selecting until it finds a valid word.

<br>

```python
def get_valid_word(words):
    word = random.choice(words)
    while '-' in word or ' ' in word:
        word = random.choice(words)
    return word

```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


 ### ðŸŸ¡ 7.


 -  Import `string` ,  to **access** the uppercase **alphabet**



```python
import random
from file_withwords import words
import string âœ‹ # import this
#
```
<br>
<br>

 ### ðŸŸ¡ 8. Initialize the Game:

 -  - ðŸŸ  It selects a valid word for the game, initializes the sets for the letters in the word, the alphabet, and used letters.

 - - #### ðŸŸ¦ Purpose:

 <br>

 - - **Checks** if the **guess** is **valid and unused**.

- - **Updates** the **state** based on **whether** the **guess** is **correct or not**.

- - **Provides feedback** to the **user** if the **guess** has **already** been **used or is invalid**


<br>


```python
def hangman():
    word = get_valid_word(words) # the get_valid_word is the first function. the ones that handles (selects a random word from the words list, **ensuring** it **doesn't contain hyphens or spaces**.)


    #
    #
    word_letters = set(word) #`word_letters` is a `set` of **unique letters** in the `word` to be **guessed**
    alphabet = set(string.ascii_uppercase) #`alphabet` is a `set` **of all uppercase letters**.
    used_letters = set() #`used_letters` keeps **track of letters** that the **user has guessed** so far.

```

<br>

 - - ðŸŸ¢ `word` is `set` to a valid **random word**.

 - - ðŸŸ¢ `word_letters` is a `set` of **unique letters** in the `word` to be **guessed**.


 - - ðŸŸ¢ `alphabet` is a `set` **of all uppercase letters**.


 - - ðŸŸ¢ `used_letters` keeps **track of letters** that the **user has guessed** so far.



<br>
<br>

 ### ðŸŸ¡ 9. Prompts the user to guess a letter

- Prompts the user to guess a letter and converts their input to uppercase for consistency with the game logic.

 <br>

```python
user_letter = input("Guess a letter: ").upper()
```


<br>
<br>


 ### ðŸŸ¡ 10. Handle User Input: Prompts the user to guess a letter and processes the guess:


<br>



```python

# If it is, add it to used_letters.
    if user_letter in alphabet - used_letters:
        used_letters.add(user_letter)

        if user_letter in word_letters: # If the letter is in word_letters,
            word_letters.remove(user_letter) # it means the guess was correct, so remove it from word_letters.

```

<br>
<br>


### ðŸŸ   at this point

- You can use the **INPUT**: `input()`

- But You won't receive any error messages at this stage; those will be addressed in the **next phase**.

```python
import random
from file_withwords import words
import string


#1
def get_valid_word(words):

    word = random.choice(words)
    while '_' in word or ' ' in words:
        word = random.choice(words)

    return word


def hangman():
    word = get_valid_word(words)
    word_letters = set(word)
    alphabet = set(string.ascii_uppercase)
    used_letters = set()

    #
    #
    #
    user_letter = input("Guess a letter: ").upper()

    #
    if user_letter in alphabet - used_letters:
        used_letters.add(user_letter)

        if user_letter in word_letters:
            word_letters.remove(user_letter)

# I am going to add this block here below, but it s not going to show the messages yet
# -------------
    # elif user_letter in used_letters:
    #     print("You have already used that character. PLEASE try again.")


    # else:
    #     print("Invalid character. Please try again")
# -------------



user_input = input("Type Something: ")
print(user_input)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hangman()
```

<br>

#### Run the code `python main.py`

<br>



- you will be requested to type a letter **twice**

```bash
Type Something: e
e
GUESS A LETTER: f
```

### ðŸŸ¢ output

>It will not do anything (because we need to implement the next phase)

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  Another `WHILE` Loop

<br>

```python
while len(word_letters) > 0:
```

- - Now that we can get the user **INPUT**, I want the **user** to be able to keep guessing **UNTIL** they the **get the WORD**

<br>

- -  >Every time I am removing a letter from **word letters**, which is a **set()** of the letters of the **word** (list/Array) that we haven't seen yet, I am just keep decrementing that


- - So the condition that I have to satisfy for when the user gets all the letters in the words in the word, is:


ðŸŸ§ **while** the **length** of **word_letters** list/array is greater `>` than zero, I am going to keep iterating

```python
# similar to js but different syntax len for length
while len(word_letters) > 0:
# react
#if (wordLetters.length > 0) {
```
<br>

- ðŸ”´ You have to indent the previous code, as this new **while** loop will be position at the top of the **previous condition**

<br>


```python
 # 4
  used_letters = set()
     #           __|**|__   WHILE    __ |**|_
    #
    # 10 while the  length of word_letters list/array is greater `>` than zero, I am going to keep iterating
    while len(word_letters) > 0:

    # |**| KEEP iterating until they find - all the letters
        # 5 the letters the user will be adding
        user_letters = input("GUESS A LETTER: " ).upper()
```
<br>
<br>

### Like so

```python
 # 4
  used_letters = set()
     #           __|**|__   WHILE    __ |**|_
    #
    # 10 while the  length of word_letters list/array is greater `>` than zero, I am going to keep iterating
    while len(word_letters) > 0:

    # |**| KEEP iterating until they find - all the letters
        # 5 the letters the user will be adding
        user_letters = input("GUESS A LETTER: " ).upper()
            # 6)
        if user_letters in alphabet - used_letters:
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  `Join` the word

- `.join` will turn the list into a **string**, separated by whatever the string is.

-  you can add **white spaces, symbols, letters** , example:

-  `' '.join` or `', '.join` or `'/ '.join` etc...


```python
print("You have used these letters: ", ' '.join(used_letters))
#output
"a", "b",
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  Create a NEW LIST of words

#### Purpose:

### ðŸ”´ The code generates a new LIST, `word_list`, where each character in word is checked to see if itâ€™s present in the collection `used_letters`.

<br>


- - **If** the **letter** is **in** `used_letters`, it is **included as-is** in `word_list`.

- - **If** the **letter** is **not** in `used_letters`, an **underscore** ("_") is **included** in its place.


- -  By using **dashes** (you can use other symbols), the **user will know** what are the **words they haven't** guessed. example: `'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '_'`

<br>

```python
 #- The code generates a new list, word_list,
 # - where each character in word is checked to see if itâ€™s present in the collection used_letters.
word_list = [letter if letter in used_letters else "_" for letter in word]
# If the letter is in used_letters, it is included as-is in word_list, ELSE...
# If the letter is not in used_letters, an underscore ("_") is included in its place.
```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  Now I am going to get this "new WORD list" and I am going to `.join()` it again, so to convert it and to have this result: `"h e l l _"`


```python
    # 13
        print("Current word:", " ".join(word_list))
        # This part converts the word_list from a list of characters into a single string with each character separated by a space. For example, if word_list is ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '_'], " ".join(word_list) will produce "h e l l _"
```
