### 🟦 Structure

```javascript
project_folder/
     └── file_withwords.py
     └── helper.py
     └── main.py
```

<br>
<br>

## 🟠  1. import

- import the **random** module, then import the file with the words

```python
import random
from file_withwords import words
```

<br>
<br>

## 🟠 2. Initialization:

####  Retrieve the words from the `file_withwords.py`

-  - This is the first random selection which picks a word to start with.

<br>

```python
#1
def get_valid_word():
    #
    # 🔸 Initialization:
    #  This is the first random selection which picks a word to start with.
    word = random.choice(words)


```


<br>
<br>

## 🟠 3.  Validation Loop:

####  - The while loop checks the selected word (word) to ensure it does not contain underscores ('_') or spaces (' ').

<br>


- -  `while _ or space ''` **is in the word**,  **keep choosing a word** (If the selected word contains either an underscore or a space, the loop continues to randomly select another word from words until a valid word (without underscores or spaces) is found.)


<br>

```python
  # 🔸 Validation Loop

    while '_' in word or ' ' in words:
```
<br>

<br>

## 🟠 4.  Second `random.choice(words)`:

### Second Random Selection (random.choice(words) within the loop):

<br>

- - Inside the while loop, when word is found to contain an underscore or a space, random.choice(words) is used again to pick another random word from the list words.

<br>
