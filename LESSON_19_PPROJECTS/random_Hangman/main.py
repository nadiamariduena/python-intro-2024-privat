    # while _ or space '' is in the word, keep choosing a word (If the selected word contains either an underscore or a space, the loop continues to randomly select another word from words until a valid word (without underscores or spaces) is found.)

        # ðŸ”º Inside the while loop, when word is found to contain an underscore or a space, random.choice(words) is used again to pick another random word from the list words.
        # - This process repeats until a word is selected that meets the condition of not containing underscores or spaces.

        return word
        # - Once a valid word (one that does not contain underscores or spaces) is found, the function returns this word.
