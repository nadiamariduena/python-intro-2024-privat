# intro: imports
# import the random, string, and file containing the list of words



# ðŸŸ¦ 0
# create the function to grab the words from the list



# ðŸŸ¦ 1.a grab the data coming from the 'words'
## Pick a random word from the list




    # 1.b loop: add the condition in which you tell it:
    ## If the word has underscores or spaces...



        # 1.c # ... Pick a new word



    # 1.d # Give back the chosen word




#------------
# ðŸŸ§ # create the function to init the hangman game


    #1 make the connection to the first function


    #2 TAKES the 'word' and turns it into a special list where each letter is only listed


    #
    #3 This line creates a list of all the letters in the alphabet, from A to Z. Itâ€™s like having a list of all the letters you can use to guess the secret word.


    #
    # 4 This line starts with an empty list where you can keep track of the letters youâ€™ve already guessed. At first, itâ€™s empty because you havenâ€™t guessed any letters yet.


    #
    #
    # 5 add var and assign message input to "guess a letter:" , to uppercase()



    # CONDITION


    # 6 Check if the user letter is in the alphabet, and hasn't been used yet (used_letters)



        # 7 Add the user letter to the set of used letters


        ## 8 If the user letter is in the word letters...


             # 9 If the user letter exist within the list of word_letters, remove it
