## 🟡 Guess random number

<br>

### 🟦 For this exercise i will be using `random.randint`

- In Python, **random.randint(a, b) is a function** provided **by** the **random module**, which is part of Python's standard library.

-  This function generates a random integer
𝑁 such that `𝑎 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 𝑏`  `a≤N≤b`.


- In JavaScript (and many other programming languages), `≤ ≤` is represented as `<=`.

## 🟠 Generate a random integer

### To generate a random integer within a specified range, you use `random.randint(a, b)`, where:

<br>

🔶 **a** is the **lower** bound (inclusive) of the range.

🔵 **𝑁 (N):** This symbol is used to **represent** the **random integer** that the function generates. It can be any integer within the range specified by `𝑎 (a) and 𝑏 (b)`.

🔶 **b** is the **upper** bound (inclusive) of the range.


```python
#(a, b) , the the n will be the random number that will be generated
𝑁  such that 𝑎 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 𝑏
#
```

- which means **𝑁** is **within/between** the range from 𝑎 a to 𝑏 b, ` 🟦 🟣 🟦` inclusive.
