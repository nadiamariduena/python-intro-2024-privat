## 🟡 Guess random number

<br>

### 🟦 For this exercise i will be using `random.randint`

- In Python, **random.randint(a, b) is a function** provided **by** the **random module**, which is part of Python's standard library.

-  This function generates a random integer
𝑁 such that `𝑎 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 𝑏`  `a≤N≤b`.


- In JavaScript (and many other programming languages), `≤ ≤` is represented as `<=`.

## 🟠 Generate a random integer

### To generate a random integer within a specified range, you use `random.randint(a, b)`, where:

<br>

🔶 **a** is the **lower** bound (inclusive) of the range.

🔵 **𝑁 (N):** This symbol is used to **represent** the **random integer** that the function generates. It can be any integer within the range specified by `𝑎 (a) and 𝑏 (b)`.

🔶 **b** is the **upper** bound (inclusive) of the range.


```python
#(a, b) , the the n will be the random number that will be generated
𝑁  such that 𝑎 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 𝑏
#
```

- which means **𝑁** is **within/between** the range from 𝑎 a to 𝑏 b, ` 🟦 🟣 🟦` inclusive.

<br>


- When **we combine** these **two2** statements `𝑎 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 𝑏` with `≤ ≤`, it indicates that **𝑁** can be any number that is between **𝑎** and **𝑏**, including 𝑎 a and 𝑏 b themselves.

<br>

### 🟣 Question: this has to always be: 𝑁 , or can be anything else?

#### ✅ chatgpt:

- In **mathematics and computer science**, ✋**𝑁** is commonly used as a variable to represent a number or an integer. It's a **convention often used** to denote an arbitrary number that fits a certain condition or specification within a formula or function.

#### 🟣 So It doesn't matter which variable I use, but in most mathematical functions, 'N' is commonly used to denote the number between 'a' and 'b'. However, i can use any variable, but using 'N' is cleaner.

<br>

#### ✅ chatgpt:

Yes, you're absolutely right. In mathematics and programming, the choice of variable names is flexible, but using conventions can help with clarity and understanding, especially when communicating mathematical ideas or writing code that others may read.

<br>


### 🟧 Here are some key points:

**Flexibility in Variable Names:** You can use any variable name to represent a number or integer in a mathematical function or formula. Common choices include `'𝑁', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'm', 'n', etc`.

## 🟢 Let's continue


```python
import random
#
import random

# Define a function called guess that takes a parameter 'x'.
# Here, 'x' represents the upper limit (B) for the random number generation.
def guess(x):
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 'x'.
    random_number = random.randint(1, x)

    # Initialize 'guess' to 0. Typically, this variable would be used
    # to store the user's guess in a number guessing game scenario.
    guess = 0

# Call the guess function with x = 10.
# limit is 10, can be 100 , 300 etc
guess(10)
```
