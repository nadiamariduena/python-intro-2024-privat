### If you have many of this `print("")` on your code, you can remove all of them depending on the situation

- If you remove them add this `\n`

```python
#  print("")
   print("\nYou choose " + str(RPS(player)).
```

## DEF

- to start with a function you will use the **def** that stands for **defining**

```python
def hello():
   print('Hello World')
#
#
# just like in js, you call the function like here below: name + parentheses
hello()
```

## NONE

- IN python **none** is neither true or false
