    # In Python, __new__ is a static method that‚Äôs responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the class. It takes the class as its first argument followed by additional arguments.

    def __init__(self, toppings, size):
    # - The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
    # - It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like (rainbow, potato but keep it clear), but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

      self.toppings = toppings # properties: toppings
      self.size = size # properties: size


# üßë‚Äçüç≥  Method to bake the pizza
def bake(self):
    print(f"Baking a {self.size}-inch pizza with {', '.join(self.toppings)} toppings!")

# üî™ Method to cut the pizza
def cut(self):
    print("Cutting the pizza into slices")
