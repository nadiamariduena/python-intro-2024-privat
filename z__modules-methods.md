# ðŸŸ  MODULES or methods

- i say methods because they are a bit similar to js methods

```python

import sys
#  without the sys you cannot EXIT the program on line 15
#
# the RANDOM module
import random
#
from enum import Enum
```

## SYS

- `sys.exit()` **is a function provided by the sys module in Python that is used to exit the Python interpreter.** It's typically called with an optional integer argument representing an exit status. If no argument is provided, it exits with a status code of zero, indicating successful termination.
