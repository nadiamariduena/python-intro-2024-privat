# ðŸŸ  MODULES or methods

- i say methods because they are a bit similar to js methods

```python

import sys
#  without the sys you cannot EXIT the program on line 15
#
# the RANDOM module
import random
#
# serves to enumerate, but doesnt have an index to iterate, for that use enumerate()
from enum import Enum
```

### ðŸŸ¡ SYS

- `sys.exit()` **is a function provided by the sys module in Python that is used to exit the Python interpreter.** It's typically called with an optional integer argument representing an exit status. If no argument is provided, it exits with a status code of zero, indicating successful termination.

### RANDOM

- The purpose of import **random** in Python is to **provide access to functions and methods** for generating random numbers, selecting random elements from sequences, shuffling sequences randomly, and more. <br> It's part of Python's standard library and is commonly used in applications that require randomness, such as simulations, games, cryptography, and statistical sampling.
