## ðŸŸ¡ Missing packets from python3.8 version


- ðŸ”´ When installing python 3.8.18 for the first time by using:  `pyenv install 3.8.18` , i notice there were a lot of missing packets

<br>

#### ðŸŸ© KEEP in mind that the ubuntu that installed, it came already with this version `python3.12` , this is the version my computer is actually using, the other versions you see below, were installed with pyenv i am using the 3.7.14 (for now, because i will be testing more)

```javascript
  system
* 3.7.14 (set by /home/mycomputer/.pyenv/version)
  3.8.10
  3.8.18
  3.10.8


```
