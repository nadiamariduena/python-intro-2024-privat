##  üî¥  Intentionally Causing a BUG

#### This is only for testing purposes because the break in this guessing game is unnecessary. here is why:

<br>

- **If** your **loop naturally exits** when a **condition is met** (like in a typical **guessing game** where the loop exits **when the guess matches the target**), ‚úã using break might be **redundant** and could **potentially complicate** the **logic**.

<br>

### üü£ QUESTION: Does Python support a 'break' statement within a while loop?

#### ‚úÖ chatgpt:

- Yes, in Python, you can use the **break** statement **to exit a while loop** prematurely.

>The break statement is typically used when a certain condition is met and you want to stop the loop immediately, regardless of whether the loop condition itself would normally allow for more iterations.


```python
import random

def guess(x):
    random_number = random.randint(1, x)
    guess = 0
    # LOOP
    # you need a loop for the guessing
    while guess != random_number:
      guess = int(input(f"Guess a number between 1 and {x}: "))
        #---
      if guess < random_number:
        print("Sorry, guess again. Too LOW ")
      elif guess > random_number:
        print("Sorry, guess again. Too high")
        # ‚úã
        break
 # ‚úã issue
    print("Yay, congrats. You have guessed the number {random_number}")


guess(10)
```
<br>


### output:

```bash
# here i guessed a number between 1 and 10, but instead of following the rule, i wanted to see what would happen if i typed 500
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 500
Sorry, guess again. Too high
# üî¥
Yay, congrats. You have guessed the number {random_number}
```

<br>
<br>

### üü£ QUESTION: Why does adding the 'break' statement ignore the condition? As a result, it seems to encounter an error but then displays 'congrats'.

#### ‚úÖ chatgpt:

- The issue you're encountering is due to how you're handling the printing of the random number at the end of your function.



<br>
<br>

### üåà solution

- I really dont need this but its just a way to solve the issue (you can also remove the **break**)

```python
 if guess == random_number:
        print(f"Yay, congrats. You have guessed the number {random_number}")

```

### like so:

```python
import random

def guess(x):
    random_number = random.randint(1, x)
    guess = 0
    while guess != random_number:
        guess = int(input(f"Guess a number between 1 and {x}: "))
        if guess < random_number:
            print("Sorry, guess again. Too LOW ")
        elif guess > random_number:
            print("Sorry, guess again. Too high")
            break  # Exit the loop if the guess is too high


            # ‚úã
    if guess == random_number:
        print(f"Yay, congrats. You have guessed the number {random_number}")

guess(10)
```
<br>

#### output

```python
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 598
Sorry, guess again. Too high
```

## üü¶ BREAK

### (Real-World Application:)

- üüß let's consider a simple game scenario where a player moves on a grid using directional **inputs:** `(up, down, left, right)`.

<br>

### üü† We'll use a loop to continuously process the player's INPUTS

 - - We'll use a loop to **continuously process** the **player's** **inputs** and **update** their **position on the grid**.

 <br>

#### Here's a conceptual example where using break can make sense:

- **break** ensures the game loop respects the player's decision to quit, providing a clear and immediate termination point for the game session.

```python
def move_player():
    #x, y = 0, 0: The player starts at position (0, 0) on a grid where x represents horizontal position and y represents vertical position.

    x, y = 0, 0  # Starting position of the player at coordinates (0, 0)

    while True:  # while True:: Start a loop that continues indefinitely until we decide to stop it.

        direction = input("Enter direction (up, down, left, right) or 'quit' to exit: ")  # Ask the player which direction they want to move

        if direction == 'up':  # If the player chooses 'up'
            y += 1  # Move the player up by increasing the y-coordinate by 1
        elif direction == 'down':  # If the player chooses 'down'
            y -= 1  # Move the player down by decreasing the y-coordinate by 1
        elif direction == 'left':  # If the player chooses 'left'
            x -= 1  # Move the player left by decreasing the x-coordinate by 1
        elif direction == 'right':  # If the player chooses 'right'
            x += 1  # Move the player right by increasing the x-coordinate by 1
        elif direction == 'quit':  # If the player chooses 'quit'
            print("Quitting game...")  # Display a message that we are quitting the game
            break  # Exit the loop and end the game if the player chooses to quit
        else:  # If the player enters any other input that is not recognized
            print("Invalid input. Please enter up, down, left, right, or quit.")  # Ask the player to enter a valid direction or 'quit'

        print(f"Player position: ({x}, {y})")  # After each move, show the player's current position on the grid

move_player()  # Call the function to start playing the game

```

## üü°  BREAK (example 2)

<br>

#### üü£ QUESTION: Can you provide a real-world scenario where the break statement is used in a loop within a banking system implemented in Python, and **explain how tokens** are managed to automatically log out a user after 3 minutes of inactivity?

<br>

#### ‚úÖ chatgpt:

- In a Python-based banking application, the break statement is crucial for managing iterative processes efficiently.


<br>


### Token-based authentication and timeout functionality

<br

- let's integrate the concept of issuing and **Verifying tokens** along with the existing **PIN-based authentication**. **Tokens will expire** if the **user** is **inactive for 3 minutes** after logging in.

```python

import time
import random
import string

# Mock banking system

# Assume the correct PIN is 1234
correct_pin = '1234'

# Dictionary to store active tokens with their expiry times
active_tokens = {}

def generate_token():
    """Generate a random 6-character alphanumeric token."""
    return ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=6))

while True:
    start_time = time.time()  # Track start time of each login attempt
    pin = input("Please enter your 4-digit PIN (or 'q' to quit): ")

    if pin == 'q':
        print("Exiting the banking system.")
        break  # Exit the loop and therefore the program

    if pin == correct_pin:
        print("PIN accepted. Welcome to your account.")

        # Generate a new token and store it with its expiry time (3 minutes)
        token = generate_token()
        token_expiry = time.time() + 180  # 180 seconds = 3 minutes
        active_tokens[token] = token_expiry

        print(f"Your token is: {token}")
        print("Token will expire in 3 minutes if inactive.")

        while True:
            # Check if current time exceeds token's expiry time
            if time.time() > active_tokens[token]:
                print("Token expired due to inactivity.")
                del active_tokens[token]
                break  # Exit the inner loop to log out the user

            action = input("Enter your action (or 'q' to logout): ")

            if action == 'q':
                print("Logging out.")
                del active_tokens[token]
                break  # Logout and exit the inner loop

            # Perform banking operations here
            print(f"Performing action: {action}")

            # Reset the token's expiry time for each action
            active_tokens[token] = time.time() + 180  # Reset expiry to 3 minutes from now

        break  # Exit the outer loop since the user has successfully logged in

    else:
        print("Incorrect PIN. Please try again.")

# Additional code for banking operations could follow after the loop
# For example, displaying account balance, making transactions, etc.

#### üü£ QUESTION: is there JWT for python?

<br>

#### ‚úÖ chatgpt: Yes, there is a widely used library for working with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in Python. The most popular library for handling JWTs in Python is PyJWT

<br>

üü† **PyJWT Library**

#### [PyJWT Tutorial: Managing Authorization using JWT in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWEIeLiysp0)

<br>

- - PyJWT is a Python library that allows you to encode and decode JWTs easily. It provides functions to create tokens, verify them, and decode them back to their original form.

#### Here‚Äôs how you can use PyJWT:

```python
# You can install PyJWT using pip:
pip install PyJWT

```

<br>

#### üêª Notes to myself üçØ:

- I already tried to set the **JWT** once (complicated but not impossible, its just a lot to be careful for a beginner), check the videos i made about the issues and solutions.

- **Private** repo: https://github.com/nadiamariduena/jwt-cookie-rtk-0/blob/master/ERR__NoTOKEN-err.md



```python
import jwt
import datetime

# Example payload (data to be encoded into JWT)
payload = {
    'user_id': 123,
    'username': 'example_user',
    'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)  # Token expiry time
}

# Example secret key (should be kept secret in a real application)
secret_key = 'your_secret_key_here'

# Encode a JWT
token = jwt.encode(payload, secret_key, algorithm='HS256')
print(f"Generated token: {token}")

# Decode the JWT
try:
    decoded_payload = jwt.decode(token, secret_key, algorithms=['HS256'])
    print("Decoded payload:", decoded_payload)
except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
    print("Token has expired.")
except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
    print("Invalid token.")

```
