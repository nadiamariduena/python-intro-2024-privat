## ðŸŸ¡ BITWISE operator

<br>

<br>

-   The `|` **operator** **or** the `union()` **method** is used to merge two sets and automatically handle duplicates.

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

<br>

```python
# merging, will ignore the duplicates
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union_set = set1 | set2  # or set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)         # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

```

<br>

- The `|` **operator** is **known** as the **"bitwise OR" operator** in many programming languages. When used with sets in Python, it performs a union operation, combining all unique elements from both sets.

> âœ‹In the context of **bitwise operations**, | operates on the individual bits of integer values, performing a bitwise OR. However, when applied to sets, it is used to compute the union of those sets.

<br>

#### ðŸ”´ NOT TO CONFUSE with the `||` **OR** operator from javascript, that one is used for `boolean` logic, evaluating to `true if at least one of its operands is true`.

- - For **non-boolean** values, it returns the first truthy value or the last value if none are truthy.

### ðŸŸ£ QUESTION: so it s not common in frontend application (that doesn't involve bits or math opeartions)?

#### âœ… chatgpt:

-
**Correct**, the `bitwise OR operator (|)` is **not commonly used in typical frontend** applications that focus on UI design, user interactions, or animations. For most frontend development tasks, **you won't find much use** for **bitwise** operations **unless you're dealing** with specific cases where **bit-level manipulation**  is beneficial.

### When Bitwise Operations Might Be Relevant

<br>

#### Feature Flags or Configuration Settings:

- - If you have a need to manage multiple boolean options compactly (e.g., feature flags), you might use bitwise operations to set, check, or toggle these flags efficiently.


### âœ‹ Custom Graphics or Game Development:

- - In cases where you're working with custom graphics rendering (like using WebGL) or game development, you might use bitwise operations for pixel manipulation or to handle various states or flags in a compact way.

<br>

### Performance Optimization:

- - For highly optimized code where you need to perform operations at the bit level for performance reasons, bitwise operations might come into play. **However, such scenarios are more specialized and less common in standard frontend development.**
