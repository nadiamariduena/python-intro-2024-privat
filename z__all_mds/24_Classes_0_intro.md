## What are Classes?

##### chapgpt

Classes are like blueprints that **define how objects should be structured and behave in a program.**

> Think of them as a way to organize and describe the characteristics and actions of things you want to represent in your code.

[code academy | classes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/classes)

In Python, **classes** are defined using the class keyword. The **first letter** of the name of the class is always **capitalized.**

```python
class Pizza:
  # Class body starts here
```

### class definitions cannot be empty

- In Python, a class definition cannot be empty. It must contain at least one statement. However, there are scenarios where you may want to define a class without immediately implementing its methods or properties. In such cases, you can use the pass statement as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors.

#### Pass

- The pass statement in Python is a null operation that does nothing. It's used as a placeholder where syntactically a statement is required, but no action needs to be taken. It's commonly used in situations like:

```python
class Pizza:
    pass  # Placeholder statement to avoid syntax error

```

- This ensures that the class definition is valid syntactically, and you can later come back and implement the methods and properties as needed.

#### Basic exercises

```python

# 1 example
#
class Vehicle:

    #In Python, __init__ is an instance method that initializes a newly created object. It takes the object as its first argument followed by additional arguments.
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def moves(self):
        print("MOves along...")
        # or  print(f"MOves along...{self.model}") , print(f"John drives a {self.make} '{self.model}'")


my_car = Vehicle("Tesla", "Model 3")

#
print(my_car.make)
print(my_car.model)

#
my_car.moves()

# OUTPUT
# Tesla
# Model 3
# MOves along...


```

## üç≠ GETTER & SETTERS

#### Getter Method:

A getter method, also known as an accessor method, is a method used to retrieve the value of a private attribute **( a variable that is not directly accessible from outside the class)**. It allows you to access the value of an attribute in a controlled manner.

#### Setter Method:

A setter method, also known as a mutator method, is a method used to modify the value of a private attribute. It provides a way to update the value of an attribute while enforcing certain conditions or validations.

#### üî∂ you need to declare the getter `@property` and setter ` @radius.setter` to use it

- you need to declare both **@property** and **@radius.setter** decorators if you want to use both the getter and setter methods within a single property in Python.

```python

# GETTER
    @property
    #
    #
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

 # SETTER
    @radius.setter
    #
    #
    def radius(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self._radius = value

```

#### @property decorator:

> This decorator is used to define a getter method for a property. When you decorate a method with @property, it becomes a property getter, and you can access it as if it were an attribute rather than a method.

#### @radius.setter decorator:

> This decorator is used to define a setter method for a property. When you decorate a method with @radius.setter, it becomes a property setter, and you can use it to set the value of the property as if it were an attribute assignment.
