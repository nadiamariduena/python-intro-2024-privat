## What are Classes?

##### chapgpt

Classes are like blueprints that **define how objects should be structured and behave in a program.**

> Think of them as a way to organize and describe the characteristics and actions of things you want to represent in your code.

In Python, **classes** are defined using the class keyword. The **first letter** of the name of the class is always **capitalized.**

```python
class Pizza:
  # Class body starts here
```

### class definitions cannot be empty

- In Python, a class definition cannot be empty. It must contain at least one statement. However, there are scenarios where you may want to define a class without immediately implementing its methods or properties. In such cases, you can use the pass statement as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors.

#### Pass

- The pass statement in Python is a null operation that does nothing. It's used as a placeholder where syntactically a statement is required, but no action needs to be taken. It's commonly used in situations like:

```python
class Pizza:
    pass  # Placeholder statement to avoid syntax error

```

- This ensures that the class definition is valid syntactically, and you can later come back and implement the methods and properties as needed.
