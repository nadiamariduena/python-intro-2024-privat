## What are Classes?

##### chapgpt

Classes are like blueprints that **define how objects should be structured and behave in a program.**

> Think of them as a way to organize and describe the characteristics and actions of things you want to represent in your code.

[code academy | classes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/classes)

In Python, **classes** are defined using the class keyword. The **first letter** of the name of the class is always **capitalized.**

```python
class Pizza:
  # Class body starts here
```

### class definitions cannot be empty

- In Python, a class definition cannot be empty. It must contain at least one statement. However, there are scenarios where you may want to define a class without immediately implementing its methods or properties. In such cases, you can use the pass statement as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors.

#### Pass

- The pass statement in Python is a null operation that does nothing. It's used as a placeholder where syntactically a statement is required, but no action needs to be taken. It's commonly used in situations like:

```python
class Pizza:
    pass  # Placeholder statement to avoid syntax error

```

- This ensures that the class definition is valid syntactically, and you can later come back and implement the methods and properties as needed.

#### Basic exercises

```python

# 1 example
#
class Vehicle:

    #In Python, __init__ is an instance method that initializes a newly created object. It takes the object as its first argument followed by additional arguments.
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def moves(self):
        print("MOves along...")
        # or  print(f"MOves along...{self.model}") , print(f"John drives a {self.make} '{self.model}'")


my_car = Vehicle("Tesla", "Model 3")

#
print(my_car.make)
print(my_car.model)

#
my_car.moves()

# OUTPUT
# Tesla
# Model 3
# MOves along...


```

# üç≠ GETTER & SETTERS

## What are Getters and Setters?

**Getters:** These are the methods used in ‚úã `Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)` which helps to access the private attributes from a class.

**Setters:** These are the methods used in OOPS feature which helps to set the value to private attributes in a class.

### üü† Private Attribute - Encapsulation

- If you are not familiar with the private attributes or private methods in Python, read this [DataCamp article> role-underscore-python](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/role-underscore-python)

<br>
<br>

#### Getter Method:

A getter method, also known as an accessor method, is a method used to retrieve the value of a private attribute **( a variable that is not directly accessible from outside the class)**. It allows you to access the value of an attribute in a controlled manner.

#### Setter Method:

A setter method, also known as a mutator method, is a method used to modify the value of a private attribute. It provides a way to update the value of an attribute while enforcing certain conditions or validations.

#### üî∂ you need to declare the getter `@property` and setter ` @radius.setter` to use it

- you need to declare both **@property** and **@radius.setter** decorators if you want to use both the getter and setter methods within a single property in Python.

```python

# GETTER
    @property
    #
    #
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

 # SETTER
    @radius.setter
    #
    #
    def radius(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self._radius = value

```

#### @property decorator:

> This decorator is used to define a getter method for a property. When you decorate a method with @property, it becomes a property getter, and you can access it as if it were an attribute rather than a method.

#### @radius.setter decorator:

> This decorator is used to define a setter method for a property. When you decorate a method with @radius.setter, it becomes a property setter, and you can use it to set the value of the property as if it were an attribute assignment.

<br>
<br>

# Differences between Python `@Property` and `Getters & Setters`

- In Python, both @property and getters/setters are ways to control access to class attributes, but they do so in slightly different manners:

 <br>
 <br>

# `@Property`

#### üî¥ `@property` is used to get the value of a private attribute without using any getter methods. We have to put a line @property in front of the method where we return the private variable.

<br>

- **@property** is a Python <u>decorator</u> that **allows defining a method** that can be accessed like an attribute.

- üü° It's used to define a getter method for a class attribute.

- When the decorated method is called, it behaves like a read-only attribute, providing computed values or ensuring controlled access.

- It simplifies the syntax by allowing you to access the method like an attribute rather than a method call.

##### example:

```python
#  üü¢  with PROPERT
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

    @property
    def diameter(self):
        return 2 * self._radius

    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self._radius ** 2

# Creating an instance of Circle
my_circle = Circle(5)

# Accessing radius, diameter, and area like attributes
print("Radius:", my_circle.radius)
print("Diameter:", my_circle.diameter)
print("Area:", my_circle.area)


#
# ------------------
# üü¶ with GETTER & SETTER
# ------------------

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius


    # GETTER
    def get_radius(self):
        return self._radius
    # SETTER
    def set_radius(self, radius):
        if radius < 0:
            raise ValueError("Radius must be non-negative")
        self._radius = radius

    # GETTER
    def get_diameter(self):
        return 2 * self._radius
    # SETTER
    def get_area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self._radius ** 2

    # defining properties
    radius = property(get_radius, set_radius)
    diameter = property(get_diameter)
    area = property(get_area)

# Creating an instance of Circle
my_circle = Circle(5)

# Accessing radius, diameter, and area like attributes
print("Radius:", my_circle.radius)
print("Diameter:", my_circle.diameter)
print("Area:", my_circle.area)


```

#### me:

- so its cleaner to use `@properyty`, but confusing for beginners, as there is no way to know whcih is the `getter` and the `setter`

#### chatgpt:

**That's a valid point.** While `@property` simplifies syntax and enhances readability, especially for those familiar with Python, it might indeed be a bit confusing for beginners who are not aware of the getter and setter methods implicitly defined by the decorator.

Here's the same example with added comments for clarity:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    # getter
    def radius(self):
        """Getter method for the radius attribute."""
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    # @radius.setter is a decorator used in Python to define a setter method for a property.
    def radius(self, radius):
        """Setter method for the radius attribute."""
        if radius < 0:
            raise ValueError("Radius must be non-negative")
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def diameter(self):
        """Getter method for the diameter attribute."""
        return 2 * self._radius

    @property
    def area(self):
        """Getter method for the area attribute."""
        return 3.14159 * self._radius ** 2

# Creating an instance of Circle
my_circle = Circle(5)

# Accessing radius, diameter, and area like attributes
print("Radius:", my_circle.radius)
print("Diameter:", my_circle.diameter)
print("Area:", my_circle.area)

```

### @radius.setter decorates the setter method immediately following it (def radius(self, radius)), indicating that this method should be associated with setting the radius property.

- So, when you try to assign a value to **my_circle.radius**, Python automatically calls the setter method **radius(self, radius)** with the assigned value, enabling you to perform any necessary validation or computations before setting the attribute `_radius`.

In simpler terms, it allows you to use `my_circle.radius =` value syntax to set the radius property, and the associated setter method radius(self, radius) will be invoked with the provided value.

# üî¥ In other words, similar to the useState `const [ state, setState] = useState()`?

#### chatgpt:

> Yes, in React's functional components, `useState()` **hook** is used to create state variables.

- üü° It returns an **array containing** the **current state** value as the **first element**, and a function to update the state as the **second element**.
