## What are Classes?

##### chapgpt

Classes are like blueprints that **define how objects should be structured and behave in a program.**

> Think of them as a way to organize and describe the characteristics and actions of things you want to represent in your code.

### When you create a class, you're essentially creating a template for creating objects.

> This template specifies what kind of data the object can hold (properties) and what operations it can perform (methods).
