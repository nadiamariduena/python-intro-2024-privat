## ðŸŸ  Virtual Environment

#### It's pretty normal to have multiple Python applications running on your computer. Sometimes, one app wants a specific version of a module, while another app wants a different version of the exact same module.

ðŸ”¸ So how can you provide 2 VERSIONS of the same module?

- ðŸ”´ Remember, when you use pip to install updates, it affects all Python programs on your computer. For example, if you update a module like requests using pip, every Python program that uses requests will now use the updated version.
