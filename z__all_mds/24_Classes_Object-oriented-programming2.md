## [Python Classes, Objects, Inheritance & Polymorphism for Beginners](https://youtu.be/RpBBzci_cBk?feature=shared)

## OOP (object-oriented programming)

Classes are an important concept in **object-oriented programming** (OOP), a programming paradigm that focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects.

- In **OOP**, you create instances of classes, which are like copies of the blueprint, and then work with those instances to perform tasks and solve problems.

-üçì Classes help organize and manage the complexity of large programs by providing a way to structure code and promote reusability through concepts like inheritance and encapsulation.

### When you create a class, you're essentially creating a template for creating objects.

> This template specifies what kind of data the object can hold (properties) and what operations it can perform (methods).

<br>

- üçï Imagine you're a **pizza chef** at a virtual pizza restaurant, and you want to **create** a special "Pizza" **class to represent different types of pizzas** you can make. example:

```python
# intro
#
#
#
# Define the Pizza class
class Pizza:
    # Constructor method to initialize the pizza with toppings and size
    #
    # ** __new__ Method in Python Defined
    # In Python, __new__ is a static method that‚Äôs responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the class. It takes the class as its first argument followed by additional arguments.

    # 1
    def __init__(self, toppings, size):
    # - The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
    # - It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like (rainbow, potato but keep it clear), but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

      self.toppings = toppings # properties: toppings
      self.size = size # properties: size


    # 2 üßë‚Äçüç≥  Method to bake the pizza
    def bake(self):
        print(f"Baking a {self.size}-inch pizza with {', '.join(self.toppings)} toppings!")

    # 3 üî™ Method to cut the pizza
    def cut(self):
        print("Cutting the pizza into slices")

    # 4 üçΩÔ∏è Method to serve the pizza
    def serve(self):
        print("Enjoy your delicious pizza")


# 5 TOPPINGS
# Create instances of the Pizza class
# We create two instances of the Pizza class (hawaiian_pizza and pepperoni_pizza) with different toppings and sizes.
hawaiian_pizza = Pizza(["ham", "pineapple"], 12) # 12 is the 3 argument on line 13, which is then assigned to self.size
pepperoni_pizza = Pizza(["pepperoni", "cheese", "tomato sauce"], 16)

# 6 We then use the methods of each pizza object to bake, cut, and serve the pizzas.
# Make and serve the pizzas
hawaiian_pizza.bake()
hawaiian_pizza.cut()
hawaiian_pizza.serve()

# OUTPUT
# Baking a 12-inch pizza with ham, pineapple toppings!
# Cutting the pizza into slices
# Enjoy your delicious pizza

pepperoni_pizza.bake()
pepperoni_pizza.cut()
pepperoni_pizza.serve()

# output
#Baking a 16-inch pizza with pepperoni, cheese, tomato sauce toppings!
# Cutting the pizza into slices
# Enjoy your delicious pizza
```
