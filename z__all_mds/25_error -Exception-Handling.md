### QUESTION: Explain the purpose and give me some example of Exception Handling

> 💡 **Exception handling is a programming mechanism designed to handle and manage errors that occur during the execution of a program.**

- It allows developers to anticipate and manage unforeseen circumstances that might disrupt normal program flow.

## 🟣 Difference between Error and Exception:

- In programming, ✋ error and exception are related but **distinct concepts**:

<br>

🚩 **Error:** Typically refers to a mistake made by the programmer that results in a program that cannot run. For example, syntax errors <u>(like a missing parenthesis) or logical errors (where the program does not perform as intended)</u> .

<br>

🏴 **Exception:** An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions during execution. Exceptions can occur due to factors **outside the programmer's control**, such as <u>invalid user input, network issues, file I/O errors, etc</u> . Exceptions are typically handled by the program to prevent crashes and manage unexpected situations.

<br>

> 💡 In summary, while errors are mistakes that prevent a program from running correctly due to programming faults, exceptions are events that occur during execution and are managed by exception handling mechanisms to ensure robust and predictable program behavior.
