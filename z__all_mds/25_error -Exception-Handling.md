## 🟡 Error/Exception Handling

[Python Exception Handling Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/PHzm_Iox1mE?feature=shared)

- I will be following the examples of the above video at the bottom of this file, first i will ask **chatgpt** some qquestions.

<br>
<br>

### 🙋‍♀️ QUESTION: Explain the purpose and give me some example of Exception Handling

<br>

##### chatgpt:

> 💡 **Exception handling is a programming mechanism designed to handle and manage errors that occur during the execution of a program.**

- It allows developers to anticipate and manage unforeseen circumstances that might disrupt normal program flow.

<!-- #### The primary purposes of exception handling are: -->

### 🟣 Difference between Error and Exception:

- In programming, ✋ error and exception are related but **distinct concepts**:

<br>

🚩 **Error:** Typically refers to a mistake made by the programmer that results in a program that cannot run. For example, syntax errors <u>(like a missing parenthesis) or logical errors (where the program does not perform as intended)</u> .

<br>

🏴 **Exception:** An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions during execution. Exceptions can occur due to factors **outside the programmer's control**, such as <u>invalid user input, network issues, file I/O errors, etc</u> . Exceptions are typically handled by the program to prevent crashes and manage unexpected situations.

<br>

> 💡 In summary, while errors are mistakes that prevent a program from running correctly due to programming faults, exceptions are events that occur during execution and are managed by exception handling mechanisms to ensure robust and predictable program behavior.

### 🙋‍♀️ QUESTION: so its similar to the <u>Try & Catch</u> on react and javascript?

##### chatgpt:

<br>

✅ **Yes**, exception handling in programming languages like Python and error handling in JavaScript (including React) serve similar purposes, although the **syntax** and specific **mechanisms** <u>differ</u> slightly.

<br>

#### 👬 Similarities:

**Purpose:** Both Python's try-except blocks and JavaScript's try-catch blocks serve the purpose of handling and managing errors or exceptions that occur during program execution.

#### Here's how they compare:
