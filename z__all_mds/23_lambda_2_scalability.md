### Is a lambda function useful on large applications, like spotify? and if yes add a real scenario

- Lambda functions, while handy for smaller tasks and certain types of operations, might not be the primary choice for large-scale applications like Spotify's backend.

- âœ‹ This is mainly because large-scale applications often **require** complex logic, **maintainability, and scalability**, which lambda functions, with their **limitations** (like being expression-based and anonymous), might not fully address.
