## LAMBDA scalability

##### Questions to chapgpt

### Is a lambda function useful on large applications, like spotify? and if yes add a real scenario

- Lambda functions, while handy for smaller tasks and certain types of operations, might not be the primary choice for large-scale applications like Spotify's backend.

- This is mainly because large-scale applications often require complex logic, maintainability, and scalability, which lambda functions, with their limitations (like being expression-based and anonymous), might not fully address.
