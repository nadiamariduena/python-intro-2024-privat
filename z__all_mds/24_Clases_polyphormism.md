# POLYPHORMISM

- Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.

> 🍊 This **means that you can create multiple classes that share a common interface or base class** and then use these classes interchangeably, depending on the context.

### 🎠 Explanation /PIZZA example

Imagine you're the master chef of a pizza parlor, and you've got a **magical 🤹‍♂️ oven** that can cook any type of pizza, whether it's loaded with pepperoni, veggies, or BBQ chicken.

- **polymorphism** is like having this **superpower** where you can treat all these different pizzas as if they're just regular pizzas.

let's dive into our pizza adventure!

- 🍕 Imagine we've got a bunch of pizzas with all sorts of yummy toppings. But here's the twist: each pizza has its own special recipe, like the Pepperoni Pizza, the Veggie Pizza, and the BBQ Chicken Pizza.

Now, imagine these pizzas as a big pizza family.

🟣 **The big boss pizza,** let's call it the "Pizza Boss", is the **superclass**. <u>It's like the head honcho pizza that all other pizzas look up to. </u>

🔶 Then, we've got the Pepperoni Pizza, the Veggie Pizza, and the BBQ Chicken Pizza as the little pizza siblings. They're all different but still part of the same pizza family.
