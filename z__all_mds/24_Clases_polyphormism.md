# POLYPHORMISM

- Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.

- 🍊 This **means that you can create multiple classes that share a common interface or base class** and then use these classes interchangeably, depending on the context.

#### 🎠 Explanation:

- 1 Imagine you're the master chef of a pizza parlor, and you've got a **magical 🤹‍♂️ oven** that can cook any type of pizza, whether it's loaded with pepperoni, veggies, or BBQ chicken.

> 2 Now, **polymorphism** is like having this **superpower** where you can treat all these different pizzas as if they're just regular pizzas.
