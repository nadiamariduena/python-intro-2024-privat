# POLYPHORMISM

- Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.

> 🍊 This **means that you can create multiple classes that share a common interface or base class** and then use these classes interchangeably, depending on the context.

### 🎠 Explanation /PIZZA example

Imagine you're the master chef of a pizza parlor, and you've got a **magical 🤹‍♂️ oven** that can cook any type of pizza, whether it's loaded with pepperoni, veggies, or BBQ chicken.

- **polymorphism** is like having this **superpower** where you can treat all these different pizzas as if they're just regular pizzas.

<br>

let's dive into our pizza adventure!

- 🍕 Imagine we've got a bunch of pizzas with all sorts of yummy toppings. But here's the twist: each pizza has its own special recipe, like the Pepperoni Pizza, the Veggie Pizza, and the BBQ Chicken Pizza.

Now, imagine these pizzas as a big pizza family.

🟣 **The big boss pizza,** let's call it the "Pizza Boss", is the **superclass**. <u>It's like the head honcho pizza that all other pizzas look up to. </u>

🔶 Then, we've got the Pepperoni Pizza, the Veggie Pizza, and the BBQ Chicken Pizza as the little pizza siblings. They're all different but still part of the same pizza family.

#### So, polymorphism is like saying:

- "Hey, you know what? Even though you're a Pepperoni Pizza, a Veggie Pizza, or a BBQ Chicken Pizza, I can treat you **all** as if you're just regular pizzas!"

- Now, let's fire up that oven and get cooking! 🚀 **We'll loop through each** <u>pizza</u> in our pizza family, and even though they're all different, we'll use their special cooking methods. It's like having a pizza party where everyone brings their own flavor to the table!

#### That's polymorphism in action. Treating different pizzas as if they're all just part of the same delicious pizza family! 🍕🎉
