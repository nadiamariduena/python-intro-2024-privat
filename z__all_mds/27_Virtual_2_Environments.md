## ðŸ”´ ACTIVATION issue

#### âœ‹ the below happened because i had installed python on the python that already comes with some version of ubuntu

<br>

- When i tried to **CREATE** the **env** folder by using this command `python -m venv .venv` , like you see in in the tutorial [6:25 | Python Virtual Environment and pip for Beginners](https://youtu.be/eDe-z2Qy9x4?si=lsQnQ4eoy07Caa1v&t=385), so to create the venv folder, **it works BUT âœ‹** it DOESN'T CREATE the **SCRIPTS** folder that also comes within the **`.venv` folder**, ðŸŸ¥ this script folder is important because it comes with some **activation files** , the ones you will always need, check the example: [6:35 | Python Virtual Environment and pip for Beginners](https://youtu.be/eDe-z2Qy9x4?si=3Bg6wM1cXGlaqqh-&t=395)

<br>

#### In the beginning i thought the problem had something to do with this warning i was getting every time i try to install something using PIP:

```javascript
 WARNING: The script virtualenv is installed in '/home/myComputer/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

```
