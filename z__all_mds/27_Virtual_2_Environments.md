## üî¥ ACTIVATION issue

#### üåà REASON: the below happened because i had installed python on the python that already comes with some version of ubuntu, so at the end they clashed.

<br>

#### explanation:

- When i tried to **CREATE** the **env** folder by using this command `python -m venv .venv` , like you see in in the tutorial [6:25 | Python Virtual Environment and pip for Beginners](https://youtu.be/eDe-z2Qy9x4?si=lsQnQ4eoy07Caa1v&t=385), so to create the venv folder, **it works BUT ‚úã** it DOESN'T CREATE the **SCRIPTS** folder that also comes within the **`.venv` folder:**

```javascript
//  If it fails, you will only have the below, but inside the bin you will only have some binary python files, not the activation & pip files, such as: pthon and python3

- bin

- include

- lib

- lib64

- pyvenv.cfg
```



üü• this `/SCRIPT` **folder** is important because it comes with some **activation files** , the ones you will always need to generate the **virtual environment** `(env)`.

- check the example: [6:35 | Python Virtual Environment and pip for Beginners](https://youtu.be/eDe-z2Qy9x4?si=3Bg6wM1cXGlaqqh-&t=395)

<br>

<br>

## üü° PATH issue

#### Path issue i though it was connected with the environment not generating the activation files

<br>

- In the beginning i thought the problem had something to do with this **warning** i was getting every time i try to install something using **PIP**:

```javascript
 WARNING: The script virtualenv is installed in '/home/myComputer/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

```

## üî¥ POSSIBLE reasons


### After reading about the TOPIC, i found the following:

1. It appears that the `python3-venv` package is not available in your current package repositories. This can happen for a few reasons, such as repository **misconfiguration** or changes in **package availability**.

<br>

## üü° Other Options:


####  üü¢ Other options you can use instead of the VIRTUAL environment offered by PYTHON

<br>

- Either by using **PyEnv** so to have the possibilities to have several python versions, or by using a **library/tool** such as **VIRTUALENV**

<br>
<br>


### üü¢ PyENV

- PyEnv for multiple python versions (one option)

[ENV_ubuntu-version-issue, install PyEnv for multiple python versions](../z__ENV_ubuntu-version-issue.md)

 <br>

### üü¢ VirtualENV

- Before installing anything related to the VIRTUALENV, check if you already have this: [z\_\_ENV_PATH_issue](../z__ENV_PATH_issue.md), if you have it, you can continue" but if not, just go the link and follow the steps. ‚úã to install [VIRTUALENV click here](../z__ENV_VIRTUALENV%20.md)

## üåà GENERATING VIRTUAL env with virtualenv

<br>



- After installing the **virtualEnv** i can continue with the activation but before that, i will create the ENV folder using a different command [min: 3:23 | Entornos Virtuales con Python (M√≥dulo virtualenv) ‚úÖ | Curso Python 3 üêç # 63](https://youtu.be/TNtrAvNNxTY?si=Ek5y67rtAx4DWwQP&t=203) , **as i am now using virtualenv** instead of the python env, it's different to what you can see in the tutorial i have been watching [min: 7:16 | Python Virtual Environment and pip for Beginners](https://youtu.be/eDe-z2Qy9x4?si=rLciMOjDfQO8l3sg&t=436)

## üëæ creating the env

- creating the **env** with **virtualEnv**

- choose the project where you are going to install the env folder, in my case i will choose `/LESSON_16_OOP` , once you have cd into that project, type the following:

```javascript
virtualenv -p python3 env

// -  -p python3: This specifies that you want to use Python 3 as the interpreter for creating the virtual environment.
//
// - If you omit the -p option, virtualenv will use the default Python interpreter that is available on your system when creating the virtual environment.
//

```

#### output

```javascript
created virtual environment CPython3.8.10.final.0-64 in 307ms
