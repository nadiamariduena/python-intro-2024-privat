# 🟠CLASSES: [Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp)

### Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

**Parent class** 🧑‍🦲 is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

**Child class** 👶 is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

#### question:

so inheritance classes in python, works like the 🍰 **gremlins** react when pured water?

##### chatgpt:

Haha, that's an interesting comparison!

- In Python, inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, which can be a bit like multiplying the functionality, much like the gremlins multiplying when they come in contact with water 🌧️.

But unlike the **gremlins...** inheritance in Python is usually a good thing!

- It helps in creating hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting code reusability, and making your code more organized and easier to maintain. Plus, you won't have to worry about your code causing chaos if it encounters water!
