# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

<br>
<br>

#### ðŸŸ£ Question: Tell me about OOP in python, uses, purpose, For what its most widely used?

<br>

##### Chatgpt:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a powerful paradigm that allows you to structure your code in a way that models real-world entities and relationships, making it easier to manage and build complex applications. Here are some key aspects and uses of OOP in Python:

<br>

## Key Concepts in OOP:

<br>

#### ðŸŸ¡ 1) Classes and Objects:

**Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that are common to all instances of the class.
[24_Classes_0_intro](./24_Classes_0_intro.md)

<br>

**Object:** An instance of a class. It encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) specific to that instance. [24_Classes_Object-oriented-programming2](24_Classes_Object-oriented-programming2.md)

<br>
<br>

#### ðŸŸ¡ 2) Encapsulation

- Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).

> It allows you to hide the internal state and require all interactions to be performed through well-defined interfaces (methods).

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand      # Public attribute (encapsulation not directly related here)
        self.__model = model    # Private attribute (encapsulation)

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand}, Model: {self.__model}")  # Encapsulation in action (accessing private attribute indirectly)

    def update_model(self, new_model):
        self.__model = new_model  # Encapsulation in action (updating private attribute)

# Creating an object of Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

# Accessing public attribute directly (not encapsulation per se)
print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota

# Trying to access private attribute directly raises an error
# print(my_car.__model)  # AttributeError: 'Car' object has no attribute '__model'

# Accessing private attribute indirectly using a method
my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota, Model: Corolla

# Updating private attribute using a method
my_car.update_model("Camry")
my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota, Model: Camry

```

<br>

### Encapsulation, in this context, refers to the practice of bundling the data `(brand and __model attributes)` and methods

`(display_info()` and `update_model())` that operate on that data within a single unit `(the Car class)`.

> âœ‹It helps in controlling access to the data and ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through well-defined methods, thereby protecting the integrity of the object's state.

#### ðŸŸ¡ 3) Inheritance:

Allows one class (**subclass** or **derived class**) to inherit and extend the functionality of another class (superclass or base class).

- This promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical classification of objects.
