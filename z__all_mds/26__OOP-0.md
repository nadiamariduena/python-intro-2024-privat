# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

<br>
<br>

#### üü£ Question: Tell me about OOP in python, uses, purpose, For what its most widely used?

<br>

##### Chatgpt:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a powerful paradigm that allows you to structure your code in a way that models real-world entities and relationships, making it easier to manage and build complex applications. Here are some key aspects and uses of OOP in Python:

<br>

## Key Concepts in OOP:

<br>

#### üü° 1) Classes and Objects:

**Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that are common to all instances of the class.
[24_Classes_0_intro](./24_Classes_0_intro.md)

<br>

**Object:** An instance of a class. It encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) specific to that instance. [24_Classes_Object-oriented-programming2](24_Classes_Object-oriented-programming2.md)

<br>
<br>

#### üü° 2) Encapsulation

- Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).

> It allows you to hide the internal state and require all interactions to be performed through well-defined interfaces (methods).

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand      # Public attribute (encapsulation not directly related here)
        self.__model = model    # Private attribute (encapsulation)

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand}, Model: {self.__model}")  # Encapsulation in action (accessing private attribute indirectly)

    def update_model(self, new_model):
        self.__model = new_model  # Encapsulation in action (updating private attribute)

# Creating an object of Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

# Accessing public attribute directly (not encapsulation per se)
print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota

# Trying to access private attribute directly raises an error
# print(my_car.__model)  # AttributeError: 'Car' object has no attribute '__model'

# Accessing private attribute indirectly using a method
my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota, Model: Corolla

# Updating private attribute using a method
my_car.update_model("Camry")
my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota, Model: Camry

```

<br>

### Encapsulation, in this context, refers to the practice of bundling the data `(brand and __model attributes)` and methods

`(display_info()` and `update_model())` that operate on that data within a single unit `(the Car class)`.

> ‚úãIt helps in controlling access to the data and ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through well-defined methods, thereby protecting the integrity of the object's state.

<br>
<br>

#### üü° 3) Inheritance:

Allows one class (**subclass** or **derived class**) to inherit and extend the functionality of another class (superclass or base class).

- This promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical classification of objects.

<br>

#### question:

so inheritance classes in python, works like the üç∞ **gremlins** react when pured water?

##### chatgpt:

Haha, that's an interesting comparison!

- In Python, inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, which can be a bit like multiplying the functionality, much like the gremlins multiplying when they come in contact with water üåßÔ∏è.

But unlike the **gremlins...** inheritance in Python is usually a good thing!

- It helps in creating hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting code reusability, and making your code more organized and easier to maintain. Plus, you won't have to worry about your code causing chaos if it encounters water!

#### Parent class

- under this parent class i will be adding the **child or inherited class**

```python
 # ** 0
class IceCreamStore:


    # ** 1 INIT ---------------
    #
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the
        IceCreamSTore with an empty list of toppings and a default
        extra topping COST
        """
        # ** 2
        self.toppings = []
        self.extra_topping_cost = 0.80 # The cost for extra toppings, because who doesn't love some extra toppings?
    # -------------------------
    #
    #
    #
    #
    # ** 3 ---- ADD TOPPING
    #
    def add_topping(self, topping, extra=False):

        """

        Add a topping to the ICE cream

        Args:

        - topping (str): the topping to be added.

        - extra (bool, optional): Whether the topping is extra. Defaults to FALSE

        """
        # ** 4 ---- EXTRA
        # conditional for extra topping
        #
        if extra:
            self.toppings.append((topping, self.extra_topping_cost))  # If extra, append with extra cost
        else:

            self.toppings.append((topping, 0)) # Otherwise, no extra cost
        #
        #
        # ---------


    # ** 5 ---- LIST of Toppings
    #
    def list_toppings(self):
        """
       üóíÔ∏è List all available toppings, indicating if they are extra or not."""

        print("Available toppings:")

        #
        # iterate on topping
        #
        for topping, cost in self.toppings:
            if cost == 0:
                print("- " + topping)
            else:
                print("- " + topping + " (Extra $" + str(cost) +  ")")


#
#

# ---------------------------
# Test the parent class
# ---------------------------

regular_store = IceCreamStore()
regular_store.add_topping(" chocolate üç´")
regular_store.add_topping("Nuts üå∞", extra=True)
regular_store.list_toppings()

print("-----/------")

# ** result
# this first result will show you the outcome of the PARENT class
# Available toppings:
# -  chocolate üç´
# - Nuts üå∞ (Extra $0.8)
# -----/------
```

#### child class

```python

# ** --------- inherited class ------------
# STEP 6: Define the Special Ice Store class, inheriting from
class IceCreamStoreInherited(IceCreamStore):
    def __init__(self):
          """üç¶Initialize the IceCreamStoreInherited, calling the parent class's __init__ method. üç¶"""
          #
          #ü§ö
          super().__init__() # Call the __init__ method of the parent class
          self.special_topping = "Magic Sprinkles" # The special topping that adds a touch of magic
          #
          # ** - super() is a built-in function used to access methods and properties from a parent class.
          # - It returns a proxy object that allows you to call methods of the superclass (parent class) in a subclass (child class).

#
#
# -----------
# ADD special TOPPING üéä
# -----------

    def add_special_topping(self):
        """ADD the special topping üå∂Ô∏è to the ice cream"""
        #
        #So, in summary, this line is adding the special topping "Magic Sprinkles" to an ice cream instance (self) using the add_topping method, and it's explicitly specifying that this topping is extra.
        self.add_topping(self.special_topping, extra=True)
        #
        # the .add() method is primarily associated with set objects. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. The .add() method is used to add a single element to a set. If the element is already present in the set, the set remains unchanged. ( check the example on the md) üñêÔ∏è BUT IN THIS CASE, we are not making use of the add() method but to another function in STEP 3


# ---------------------------
# Test the child class
# ---------------------------

special_store =  IceCreamStoreInherited()
special_store.add_topping("banana üçå")
special_store.add_special_topping()
special_store.list_toppings()

# result
# this second result will show you the outcome of the CHILD class
#
# Available toppings:
# - banana üçå
# - Magic Sprinkles (Extra $0.8)
```
