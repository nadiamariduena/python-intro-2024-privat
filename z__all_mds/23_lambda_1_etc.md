- to test any example, **CD** into the folder you have stored the **py** file , for example, i have my py file within a folder called **LESSON_13_lambda_map_etc**, so if i want to test my examples, i need to cd on that folder and then type this:

### üç≠ Lambda

- Lambda typically refers to the lambda function in Python, which is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
# 3 +5 = 8
```

<br>

### üç≠ In Python, a lambda function is a way to create small, anonymous functions. They are similar to regular functions defined using the def keyword, but with a few key differences:

<br>

- **Anonymous:** Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name like regular functions do. They are defined using the lambda keyword followed by parameters and an expression.

```python
# Anonymous lambda function to calculate the square of a number
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
#
#
# ‚úã another example
# a) we cannot do this
lambda num : num * num
# b) we can assign the lambda anony function to a variable, in this case will be 'squared'
squared = (lambda num : num * num)
```

## üî¥ Reformating issue

```python
#üñêÔ∏è here you have to be careful, if you dont add parenthesis to the lambda like here (lambda num : num * num), it will reformat it, and you wont get the result 4
squared = (lambda num1 : num1 * num1)
print(squared(2))
#result: 4 // num + num or 2 + 2 = 4
# the reformat happens in line 8, when typing (squared(2))
```

### this is what you get if ou dont add the parenthesis

```python
def squared(num): return num + num
print(squared(2))
#result
#4 // num + num or 2 + 2 = 4
```

<br>

#### another anonym function

```python
# ------- another example
def addTwo(num): return num + 2

print(addTwo(12))
#result
# 14
```

<br>
<br>

**Small:** Lambda functions are typically used for small tasks and simple operations. They are often used where a function is needed for a short period of time and creating a named function would be overkill.

```python
# Using lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

```

<br>

**Expression-based:** Lambda functions can only contain a single expression. This means they are limited in what they can do compared to regular functions, which can contain multiple statements and have more complex logic.

```python
# Using lambda function to check if a number is even
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(is_even(4))  # Output: True
# Examples of odd numbers are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,‚Ä¶
# Examples of even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,‚Ä¶
```

#### another function expression

```python
def sum(a, b): return a + b
print(sum(2, 2))
```

<br>

<br>

#### Lambda functions are often used in Python in situations where a function is required as an argument to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

They are a convenient way to define simple functions inline without the need for a full function definition.

## ALSO:

-In mathematics, lambda (Œª) often denotes a parameter or variable in functions or calculus.

- ‚úã In computer science and distributed systems, ["Lambda"](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf3S1nW6pAbjQs9UkM1QB0OQYXuuzn5CBnmUqHWFRJDXD2KDAMC5msYaAvVVEALw_wcB&trk=c8019b8a-d2f2-4ec8-ac50-7bdc0dbe1996&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf3S1nW6pAbjQs9UkM1QB0OQYXuuzn5CBnmUqHWFRJDXD2KDAMC5msYaAvVVEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651612391322!e!!g!!lambda%20aws!19828205892!147081379877) can refer to AWS Lambda, which is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services.

- In functional programming languages like Lisp, lambda denotes an anonymous function.

# Concatenation

- first check this example, then in the second example you will see another way of doing it and why you have to add **str**

```python
# notice what is happening here
def funcBuilder(x):
    return lambda num: num + x

addTen = funcBuilder(10)
addTwenty = funcBuilder(20)

print(addTen(7))
print(addTwenty(7))

# result
#17
# 27

```
