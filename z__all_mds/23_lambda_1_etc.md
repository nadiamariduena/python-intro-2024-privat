### üç≠ Lambda

- [LAMBDA functions](https://youtu.be/KR22jigJLok?feature=shared)

##### chatgpt

- Lambda typically refers to the lambda function in Python, which is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
# 3 +5 = 8
```

<br>

### üç≠ In Python, a lambda function is a way to create small, anonymous functions. They are similar to regular functions defined using the def keyword, but with a few key differences:

<br>

- **Anonymous:** Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name like regular functions do. They are defined using the lambda keyword followed by parameters and an expression.

```python
# Anonymous lambda function to calculate the square of a number
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
#
#
# ‚úã another example
# a) we cannot do this
lambda num : num * num
# b) we can assign the lambda anony function to a variable, in this case will be 'squared'
squared = (lambda num : num * num)
```

## üî¥ Reformating issue

```python
#üñêÔ∏è here you have to be careful, if you dont add parenthesis to the lambda like here (lambda num : num * num), it will reformat it, and you wont get the result 4
squared = (lambda num1 : num1 * num1)
print(squared(2))
#result: 4 // num + num or 2 + 2 = 4
# the reformat happens in line 8, when typing (squared(2))
```

### this is what you get if ou dont add the parenthesis

```python
def squared(num): return num + num
print(squared(2))
#result
#4 // num + num or 2 + 2 = 4
```

<br>

#### another anonym function

```python
# ------- another example
def addTwo(num): return num + 2

print(addTwo(12))
#result
# 14
```

<br>
<br>

**Small:** Lambda functions are typically used for small tasks and simple operations. They are often used where a function is needed for a short period of time and creating a named function would be overkill.

```python
# Using lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

```

<br>

**Expression-based:** Lambda functions can only contain a single expression. This means they are limited in what they can do compared to regular functions, which can contain multiple statements and have more complex logic.

```python
# Using lambda function to check if a number is even
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(is_even(4))  # Output: True
# Examples of odd numbers are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,‚Ä¶
# Examples of even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,‚Ä¶
```

#### another function expression

```python
def sum(a, b): return a + b
print(sum(2, 2))
```

<br>

---

<br>

#### Lambda functions are often used in Python in situations where a function is required as an argument to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

They are a convenient way to define simple functions inline without the need for a full function definition.

## ALSO:

-In mathematics, lambda (Œª) often denotes a parameter or variable in functions or calculus.

- ‚úã In computer science and distributed systems, ["Lambda"](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf3S1nW6pAbjQs9UkM1QB0OQYXuuzn5CBnmUqHWFRJDXD2KDAMC5msYaAvVVEALw_wcB&trk=c8019b8a-d2f2-4ec8-ac50-7bdc0dbe1996&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwsPCyBhD4ARIsAPaaRf3S1nW6pAbjQs9UkM1QB0OQYXuuzn5CBnmUqHWFRJDXD2KDAMC5msYaAvVVEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651612391322!e!!g!!lambda%20aws!19828205892!147081379877) can refer to AWS Lambda, which is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services.

# ADDITION > Concatenation

- First check this example below, then in the second example you will see another way of doing it (with concatenation) and why you have to add **str**

```python
# ‚úã example 1)
# notice what is happening here
def funcBuilder(x):
    return lambda num: num + x

addTen = funcBuilder(10)
addTwenty = funcBuilder(20)

print(addTen(7))
print(addTwenty(7))

# result
#17
# 27

```

The **funcBuilder** function returns a lambda function that takes a parameter num and adds it to x, which is provided when calling funcBuilder. This pattern is known as closure, where the returned function retains access to the variables in the scope where it was defined.

In this case, **addTen** and addTwenty are both functions created by calling funcBuilder with different values for `x`. They are essentially functions that add **10 and 20** respectively to whatever number is passed to them.

So, the type of function being created here is a closure, specifically a closure that adds a specified **number** `(x)` to another number **(num)**.

<br>
<br>

# üç≠ Concatenation

- Regarding concatenation instead of addition, if you want the function to concatenate instead of adding numbers, you would need to modify the lambda function returned by funcBuilder to perform string concatenation instead of addition. Here's how you can do it:

## ‚úã example 2

```python
def funcBuilder(x):
    # specify the str
    return lambda num: str(num) + str(x)

addTen = funcBuilder(10)
addTwenty = funcBuilder(20)

print(addTen(7))      # Output: '710'
print(addTwenty(7))   # Output: '720'

```

#### my question:

- Is it similar to JavaScript, where errors can sometimes occur due to omitting the quotation marks `""`, in the way that mixing data types in Python without specifying the appropriate conversions may lead to errors?"

#### chatgpt answer:

- üî¥ Yes, in a way, it's similar to JavaScript in that context. In JavaScript, if you try to add a number to a string without explicitly converting one of them, it will perform type coercion, resulting in concatenation. Similarly, in Python, if you try to add a string and a number, it will raise a TypeError.

#### javascript error example

```javascript
// WITH ERROR
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number " + i); // Error: Implicit conversion of number to string
}
// #Explanation: In this example, the number i is implicitly converted into a string when concatenated with the string "Number ", which may lead to unexpected behavior if arithmetic addition was intended.
//
//  ----------
//
// WITHOUT err
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number " + i.toString()); // Outputs: "Number 1", "Number 2", ..., "Number 5"
}
// Explanation: To avoid the error, explicitly convert the number i to a string using the toString() method before concatenation.
```

#### python error example

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number " + i)  # Error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
    #
#Explanation: In this example, the integer i is attempted to be concatenated with the string "Number ", causing a TypeError due to the attempt to concatenate incompatible types.
#
#
# --------
# without error
#
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number " + str(i))  # Outputs: "Number 1", "Number 2", ..., "Number 5"
    #
    #
# Explanation: To avoid the error, explicitly convert the integer i to a string using the str() function before concatenation.
```

## Spotify example

```python
# ---------- read the '23_lambda_1_etc.md'

def playlistBuilder(songs):
    #
    #
    return lambda playlist_name: f"Adding songs to {playlist_name} playlist: {', '.join(songs)}"

# List of songs for the "Chill Vibes" playlist
chill_vibes_songs = ["Song 1", "Song 2", "Song 3"]
# List of songs for the "Summer Hits" playlist
summer_hits_songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"]


# Here you are assigning the value of chill_vibes_songs to addChillVibesSongs, then the addChillVibesSongs will be appending a new song "Song 4"
# Look ath the scope of the playlistBuilder
addChillVibesSongs = playlistBuilder(chill_vibes_songs)
addSummerHitsSongs = playlistBuilder(summer_hits_songs)

# Add a new song to the "Chill Vibes" playlist
chill_vibes_songs.append("Song 4")

print(addChillVibesSongs("Chill Vibessss"))
print(addSummerHitsSongs("Summer Hits"))


```

<br>
<br>

### Understanding

**QUESTION:**

- so all the below is out of the **scope** of the playlistBuilder, that is why i can use the playlistBuilder when assigning the value to the addChillVibesSongs and eventually appending a new song ?

```python


# List of songs for the "Chill Vibes" playlist
chill_vibes_songs = ["Song 1", "Song 2", "Song 3"]
# List of songs for the "Summer Hits" playlist
summer_hits_songs = ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"]

addChillVibesSongs = playlistBuilder(chill_vibes_songs)
addSummerHitsSongs = playlistBuilder(summer_hits_songs)

# Add a new song to the "Chill Vibes" playlist
chill_vibes_songs.append("Song 4")

print(addChillVibesSongs("Chill Vibes"))
print(addSummerHitsSongs("Summer Hits"))
```
