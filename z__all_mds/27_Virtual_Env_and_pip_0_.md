- A **virtual environment** in Python is a **self-contained directory** that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, as well as additional packages.

#### 🎪 explanation

<br>

- 🧸 Imagine you have a **magical box** <u>just for your toys</u>.

- **Each box** is like a **virtual environment** for your toys.

- Inside this box, you can keep **one set of toys separate from another.**

> 🎁 This way, **the toys** from one box **don't mix** up with **toys from another**.
