### üç≠ Lambda

- Lambda typically refers to the lambda function in Python, which is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
# 3 +5 = 8
```
