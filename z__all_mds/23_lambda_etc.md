- Lambda typically refers to the lambda function in Python, which is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
# 3 +5 = 8
```

<br>

### üç≠ In Python, a lambda function is a way to create small, anonymous functions. They are similar to regular functions defined using the def keyword, but with a few key differences:

- **Anonymous:** Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name like regular functions do. They are defined using the lambda keyword followed by parameters and an expression.

```python
# Anonymous lambda function to calculate the square of a number
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25

```

<br>

**Small:** Lambda functions are typically used for small tasks and simple operations. They are often used where a function is needed for a short period of time and creating a named function would be overkill.

```python
# Using lambda function to add two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

```

<br>

**Expression-based:** Lambda functions can only contain a single expression. This means they are limited in what they can do compared to regular functions, which can contain multiple statements and have more complex logic.

```python
# Using lambda function to check if a number is even
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(is_even(4))  # Output: True
# Examples of odd numbers are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,‚Ä¶
# Examples of even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,‚Ä¶
```

#### Lambda functions are often used in Python in situations where a function is required as an argument to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

They are a convenient way to define simple functions inline without the need for a full function definition.
