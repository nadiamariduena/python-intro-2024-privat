##### chapgpt

- Yes, decorators are still widely used in Python. They provide a powerful way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual implementation. Decorators are commonly used for tasks such as logging, authentication, memoization, and more. They help in keeping the code clean, modular, and readable by separating concerns. So, if you're working in Python, decorators are definitely a tool worth knowing and using when appropriate.
