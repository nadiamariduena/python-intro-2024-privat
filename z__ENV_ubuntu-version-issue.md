## ðŸŸ¡ After reading about the TOPIC, i found the following:

- It appears that the `python3-venv` package is not available in your current package repositories. This can happen for a few reasons, such as repository **misconfiguration** or changes in **package availability**.

#### So i checked the source LIST

check your `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` **directory** to ensure they contain the correct repositories for your Ubuntu version. Hereâ€™s how you can examine them:

```javascript
// type first this:
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
// and then this:
ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

```

- output: lots of data about the ubuntu version i have

> âœ‹ **chatgpt**: It appears that your current sources **list** is primarily configured for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) with some references to focal (Ubuntu 20.04) repositories. ðŸ”´ **This mix might be causing issues with package availability, including python3-venv**.

### So i either change the UBUNTU version or I USE something that gives me the possibility to change the python version for each project

## ðŸ§¶ PYENV

**PYENV** is a great tool for managing multiple Python versions on your system, regardless of the system's default Python installation or available packages.
