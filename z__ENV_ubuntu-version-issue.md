## ðŸŸ¡ After reading about the TOPIC, i found the following:

- It appears that the `python3-venv` package is not available in your current package repositories. This can happen for a few reasons, such as repository **misconfiguration** or changes in **package availability**.

#### So i checked the source LIST

check your `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` **directory** to ensure they contain the correct repositories for your Ubuntu version. Hereâ€™s how you can examine them:

```javascript
// type first this:
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
// and then this:
ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

```
