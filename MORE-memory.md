## ü§¶ slow after UBUNTU upgrade

### CREATE more virtual MEMORY

https://www.baeldung.com/linux/proc-meminfo

```js
//1   Check the amount of swap you have
grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo
//
// 2 Turn off the swap process
sudo swapoff -a
//
// 3 Resize the swap (in my case I expanded it to 16 GB)
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=16
/*

üëç result
before adding that command 3, i had this:
SwapTotal:       2097148 kB
which corresponds to 2GB

after i typed that command
SwapTotal:             0 kB
// but at the end we will pass from having 2GB to the memmory, to 16GB
*/
//
// 4 Attach the swap to the partition
sudo mkswap /swapfile
//
// 5 Activate swap (enable it)
sudo swapon /swapfile
//
// 6 Check the new swap size
grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo
```

Increased Swap Space: The new swap file of 16 GB provides more virtual memory compared to the previous 2 GB. This can be beneficial if your system frequently runs out of physical RAM and needs to rely on swap space to prevent crashes or performance degradation.

Potential Impact on Performance: However, increasing swap space isn't always beneficial. Excessive swapping, where the system frequently moves data between physical RAM and swap space, can lead to decreased performance due to the slower access times of disk storage compared to RAM.

Disk Space Usage: Additionally, the new swap file consumes disk space. If disk space is limited and the system rarely uses swap space, creating a large swap file may not be optimal.

Customization and Optimization: Swap space size should ideally be tailored to the specific needs of your system. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Consider factors such as the amount of physical RAM, the types of applications you run, and the typical workload of the system.

In summary, whether the change is good or not depends on your system's requirements and usage patterns. If you frequently encounter memory-related issues and the system benefits from additional swap space, the change might be beneficial. However, if the system rarely uses swap space or if disk space is limited, you might need to reconsider the swap file size or explore alternative solutions.

# so is this good?

```java
SwapTotal: 2097148 kB

after i typed that command
SwapTotal: 0 kB
```

#### The command you provided effectively removed the existing swap space (which was approximately 2 GB in your case) and replaced it with a new swap file of 16 GB, as specified.

Whether this change is "good" depends on the specific requirements and usage patterns of your system:
