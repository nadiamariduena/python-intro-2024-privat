## 🟢 Why Managing Images in a Dictionary is Beneficial in Game Development

When creating games, managing images through a dictionary offers several advantages that streamline development and improve code maintainability:


#### 🟤 Organization:

 A dictionary provides a central place to manage all image paths or surfaces.

- - 🟨 This organization **simplifies the process of updating or replacing images**, as you **only need to modify the paths in one location**.

<br>

#### 🟤 Scalability:

**As your game grows and more assets are added**, a dictionary keeps things tidy and manageable.

- -  🟨 You avoid scattering image loading code across different parts of your program.

### 🫐🟡 Applying a Single ALPHA_CONVERT to All Images

- - 🟦 **First**, we'll look at how we're currently handling the alpha conversion for the images.

<br>

- - 🟢 **Then**, we'll explore a more efficient approach using a loop, allowing us to apply a single alpha conversion to all the images.

### 🟠 Before diving in, let me explain my current setup:

- In 🔴 Lesson 6, I’m using a different method for handling images compared to what’s shown in the video tutorial.

<br>

- - **Right now, I’m working with images individually and importing** them into a dictionary  named  **`image_paths = {}`** **like here below:**
