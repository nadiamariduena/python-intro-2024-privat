## 🟡  BTN Events: POLLING:

## 🫐 What is Constant polling?

> 🧸 Imagine you have a friend at a party who is in charge of keeping an eye on the front door to see if any new guests are arriving. This friend is really good at their job. They stand by the door and keep checking it all the time.

#### Now Imagine this in a video game:

You're playing a video game where you have to press buttons to make things happen, like jumping or moving your character.

> #### The game needs to know when you press a button so it can respond and make things happen in the game


<br>

### 🟣 But constant checking is going to cause performance issues?

### ✅  chatgpt:

- - Great question! **Constantly checking** for new events, like your friend constantly watching the door, **can indeed impact performance if not handled properly**. However, in practice, Pygame and other game development libraries are designed to handle event polling efficiently.

<br>

### 🟠 1. Constant polling, also known as "continuous polling,"

- - 📌  is a method of **checking the state** of input devices **(like keyboard keys, mouse buttons, or game controllers on every iteration of the game loop.)**

> #### This approach is distinct from event-driven input handling, where you respond to specific input events as they occur.

<br>

### 🟠 2. Constant polling, when referring to a loop that checks conditions or states repeatedly..

- - is indeed similar to using a for loop or a while loop to check input states or other conditions on each iteration. This is a common pattern in game development and other real-time applications where continuous monitoring is required.
