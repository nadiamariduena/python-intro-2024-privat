#  ðŸŸ¡ `Frect` Position


<br>


### ðŸŸ¦ Rectangle: use `Frect`

#### To position it in specific places we will use the `frect` instead of rect (you will see later on why).



> - - #### ðŸŸ  REMEMBER the Differences between rect & frect:

>**Rect** `uses integer` values(**20**), <u>while</u> **FRect**  uses` floating-point` values(**20.5**).

<br>


<br>
<br>



## ðŸŸ¡ Create a square/rect to use for this example:

- To understand this section, I will start with a basic cube, later on i will continue with the plane


<br>

**1.** **create** a **new variable**, call it:

`kop`

>Assign it the:`pygame.Surface` to the variable

**2.**  **kop** is a small cube/square ðŸŸ§

`kop = pygame.Surface((50, 50))`

**3.** **Add** some color to **kop**

`kop.fill("orange")`

<br>

**4.** Before positioning where the square will be, this is what we have:

```python
kop = pygame.Surface((50, 50))
kop.fill("orange")
```


### a) ðŸŸ¤ Positioning:

**5.** we will position it at the **center point** of the **CUBE**  (which give us the center of the cube, not the window).

>its a position **within**

```python
# âœ‹ the kop_rect variable, is taking the info of the cube(measurements & and color, to then create something new)
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(center=())
```

<br>

> - - #### Look at ðŸ”´ the center  <u>blue dot</u>, this is the `center =` i am talking about.
> - - - this center can be changed to topleft, bottomright etc ... (check the options below)



<br>
<br>

### If you imagine a rectangle on the "screen" (the cube is inside the screen window):

 - - you can move a `central` **point** to different positions around it, but once you move it, it no longer be the `center =` but whatever you chose in the cube, like `topleft =` or `midleft =` etc.

 - - - For example, if you move the center dot of the rectangle to the "topleft" position, it will be placed at the top-left corner of the rectangle.

#### ðŸŸ¤ The image below shows all the available position options for the rectangle:

- Here you can see the all the options

<br>
<br>

### a) ðŸŸ¤ Positioning:

**6.** Now lets add the position in the coordinate, we need 2 arguments here **x and y:** like so `(0, 30))`, 0 means that we will pos the cube at 0 position on the window, as you can see, the cube is showing only the half of its surface, and its because we specified the **center**

```python
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(center=(0, 30))
```

- The value 30 represents the y-coordinate, which means the center of the rectangle is positioned 30 pixels down from the top of the screen.

### ðŸŸ¤ which give us the below



[<img src="center_pos.jpg"/>]( )

<br>

 ```python
kop = pygame.Surface((50, 50))
kop.fill("orange")
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(center=(0, 30))
 ```

 <br>

### ðŸ”´ Not Moving the Entire Cube:

- - This does not mean that the entire object (or cube) is being moved to (0,0).

> - - - #### ðŸŒˆ Instead, it means that the position of the rectangle's center is set to (0,0).

 - - #### The overall objectâ€™s position is still relative to where it was before; only its internal alignment within the parent or coordinate system is adjusted so that its center is at the specified point.

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ¡ Other Options

```python
# Create a rectangle with different positioning options
center_rect = player_surf.get_rect(center=(100, 100))
topleft_rect = player_surf.get_rect(topleft=(50, 50))
topright_rect = player_surf.get_rect(topright=(200, 50))
bottomleft_rect = player_surf.get_rect(bottomleft=(50, 200))
bottomright_rect = player_surf.get_rect(bottomright=(200, 200))
midtop_rect = player_surf.get_rect(midtop=(100, 30))
midbottom_rect = player_surf.get_rect(midbottom=(100, 200))
midleft_rect = player_surf.get_rect(midleft=(30, 100))
midright_rect = player_surf.get_rect(midright=(200, 100))
```





<br>
<br>


## ðŸŸ¦ Play with the above table

## ðŸŸ¤ `topleft & topright`

- notice the behavior of the cube using the same positioning but using a different property (example: topleft)

```python
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(topleft=(0, 120))
# or
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(topright=(0, 120))
```

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ¤ `midbottom & midtop`

- change the values accordingly

```python
# change the values accordingly
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(midbottom=(40, 30))
kop_rect = kop.get_frect(midtop=(40, 30))
```
