### ðŸŸ  `surface.fill`

Colors in **Pygame** are typically managed using **RGB** values, where each color is represented by a combination of **Red, Green, and Blue** components. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:


<br>

1. **Color Representation**
- - - Colors in Pygame are represented as tuples of three integers, each ranging from 0 to 255, corresponding to the RGB color model:


```bash
Red: [0-255]
Green: [0-255]
Blue: [0-255]
For example:

White: (255, 255, 255)
Black: (0, 0, 0)
Red: (255, 0, 0)
Green: (0, 255, 0)
Blue: (0, 0, 255)
```
