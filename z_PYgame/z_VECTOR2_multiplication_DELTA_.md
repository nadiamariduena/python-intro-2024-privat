# 🟡 FRAME Rate independence

<br>

- Frame rate independence is a concept in game development that **ensures the game's behavior and movement remain consistent regardless of the frame rate**.



 - - #### 🔴  Essentially, it means that the speed and smoothness of animations and movements are <u>not directly tied to how many frames per second (FPS) the game is running at</u> 🔴 .

<br>

# 🟡 Why It Matters



### Consistent Experience Across Different Systems:

<br>

- - 🟤**Different systems** may run games at different frame rates.

<br>

- - 🔴 **Frame rate independence ensures that** the game behaves the same way on a high-end system running at 120 FPS and on a lower-end system running at 30 FPS.

### 🟫 Smooth Gameplay:

- -  **Without frame rate independence, if the frame rate drops**, movements and animations might slow down or become jerky. With frame rate independence, movement speed remains consistent even if the frame rate varies.
