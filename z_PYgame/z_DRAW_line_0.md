- **also**, is SVG logic a bit similar to rect? [DRAW_line_svg-vs-rect](./z_DRAW_line_svg-vs-rect_.md)

### ü´ê First I will focus on drawing a `line` (like the one you see on the video below)

### üçä In this Example, we are drawing a horizontal line on the screen:

<br>

```python

pygame.draw.line(screen, WHITE, [10, 100], [630, 100], 5)


```


- -  üçä The line **starts** at **pos**ition (`10 x, 100 y`)on the screen.  **(what would give in pos absolute: 10% x axis, 20.83 y axis)**

<br>

>It's slightly different from using absolute positioning, but the concept is similar  [read more | DRAW_line-POS-ABSOl](./z_DRAW_line-POS-ABSOl_1.md)

<br>
<br>

- - üçä This means it **begins** `10` **pixels from the left edge** and `100` **pixels from the top edge** of the screen.




> - - #### üü§ The line `extends to` position (630, 100), which places the end of the line 630 pixels from the left edge and still at 100 pixels from the top.

- -  Given the screen width of 640 pixels, this ensures the line is positioned well within the screen boundaries.
The line has a thickness of 5 pixels.

**starts** at 10,

**ends** at 630

>- - - (keep in mind that the **screen** 480, so the line will reache 630),

>`screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))`), i will be adding the entire code at the end

## üü¶ The Code

### üü† Explanation:

#### screen:

This is the surface where the line will be drawn. Typically, this is your main game window or screen where all graphical elements are displayed.

#### WHITE:

This specifies the color of the line.

- - - In pygame, colors are often defined using RGB tuples. For example, WHITE is usually defined as (255, 255, 255), which represents white in RGB color space.


#### `[10, 100]`:

This is the starting point `(x, y)` of the line.

- - - Here, the line starts at the position (10, 100) on the screen. The x-coordinate is 10, and the y-coordinate is 100.


#### `[630, 100]`:

This is the ending point (x, y) of the line. The line will end at the position (630, 100) on the screen. The x-coordinate is 630, and the y-coordinate is 100.


### `5`:

This specifies the width (or **thickness**) of the line.

 - - - **In this case, the line will be 5 pixels wide**.
