- **also**, is SVG logic a bit similar to rect? [DRAW_line_svg-vs-rect](./z_DRAW_line_svg-vs-rect_.md)

### 🫐 First I will focus on drawing a `line` (like the one you see on the video below)

### 🍊 In this Example, we are drawing a horizontal line on the screen:

<br>

```python

pygame.draw.line(screen, WHITE, [10, 100], [630, 100], 5)


```
