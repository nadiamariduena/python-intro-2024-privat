### What is the Difference between Rects & Frects

-  In Pygame, `Rect and frect (or FRect)` are **both used to represent rectangular areas**, but **they differ** mainly in the type of **precision** they **use for their coordinates and dimensions**:


<br>

## ðŸŸ   Differences

<br>

ðŸ”´ **Precision:** `Rect uses integer` values(20), while `FRect uses floating-point` values(20.5).

<br>


**Use Case:** Use `Rect` for most general purposes where integer precision is adequate, and `FRect` when you need finer control over positioning and dimensions that require floating-point precision.


#### It is ideal for pixel-perfect positioning and size definitions.

### `frect`

In Pygame, the frect type is part of the `pygame.freetype` module and is used in scenarios where you are working with text rendering and need sub-pixel accuracy. **For typical rectangle operations in Pygame, the Rect class is commonly used**.



**Example:**


```python
# âœ‹ rect
import pygame
rect = pygame.Rect(10, 20, 30, 40)

#
# âœ‹ FRECT (great precision: 30.5)
import pygame.freetype
frect = pygame.freetype.FRect(10.5, 20.5, 30.5, 40.5)
```
