### What is the Difference between Rects & Frects

-  In Pygame, `Rect and frect (or FRect)` are **both used to represent rectangular areas**, but **they differ** mainly in the type of **precision** they **use for their coordinates and dimensions**:


<br>

## ðŸŸ   Differences

<br>

ðŸ”´ **Precision:** `Rect uses integer` values(20), while `FRect uses floating-point` values(20.5).

<br>


**Use Case:** Use `Rect` for most general purposes where integer precision is adequate, and `FRect` when you need finer control over positioning and dimensions that require floating-point precision.
