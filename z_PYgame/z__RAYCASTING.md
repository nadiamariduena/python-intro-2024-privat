# ðŸŸ¡ RAYCASTING




<br>

### ðŸŸ¦ Before we get into raycasting, it's helpful to first understand Pygame's collision system.

### ðŸ¥¥ Pygame

- #### Pygame uses a variety of methods to detect collisions between shapes, such as rectangles and circles, based on their boundaries.

- - These methods are primarily designed for simpler, axis-aligned shapes, which works well for many 2D games.

### ðŸ¥¥ Raycasting

#### Raycasting, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique used to simulate the behavior of light rays, determining what they intersect in a 2D or 3D space.

- - ðŸ’¡ Understanding **Pygame's collision** system **will give** you a **solid foundation** to **better grasp** how **raycasting** can be applied.
