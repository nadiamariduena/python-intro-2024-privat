## ðŸŸ¡ For vs Map loop:

### ðŸŸ£ QUESTION: `for` loop also cause issues with certain animations in threejs, is that right?

 #### âœ… chatgpt:

Yes, that's correct. In Three.js, ðŸ”´ **using for loops in certain scenarios can lead to performance issues, especially in animations or rendering operations**.

### Hereâ€™s why:

ðŸŸ« **Batch Processing:** Three.js relies heavily on **WebGL for rendering**, and WebGL is optimized for handling large numbers of objects in batches. Using for loops to update or render individual objects can result in more draw calls, which can degrade performance.

ðŸŸ« **Efficiency with BufferGeometry:** When dealing with BufferGeometry, which is used for more efficient handling of large amounts of vertex data, iterating over vertices with for loops can be less efficient.

- - - Operations are generally optimized when handled in bulk operations or using methods designed for batch processing.

ðŸŸ« **Animation Performance:** In animations, particularly when updating multiple objects or properties, for loops can introduce performance bottlenecks if not used carefully. Using methods that leverage Three.jsâ€™s built-in optimizations or batching operations can lead to smoother animations.

 ### ðŸŸ£ Question: I've read that <u>using for loops can be less efficient for certain situations and that map might be a better alternative</u> . Does this apply to `Pygame` as well?

 #### âœ… chatgpt:

 Youâ€™ve heard correctly in many modern  React and JavaScript contexts.

ðŸŸ« **React and JavaScript**

  **Using `map` over `for` loops for rendering lists of components in React is generally recommended for several reasons**:

- - - ðŸŸ¡ **Immutability:** map does not mutate the original array but returns a new array, aligning with functional programming principles and making your code easier to reason about.

- - - **Inline Rendering:** With map, you can directly embed the logic for rendering lists of components within the JSX, which keeps your component logic more compact and expressive.

- - - **Avoid Side Effects:** map avoids the potential for side effects that could arise from modifying external variables or arrays, which is something to be cautious about when using for loops.

#### ðŸŸ£ QUESTION: "Iâ€™m not entirely sure, âœ‹ but I seem to recall that using map in this code might lead to animation issues. Could you explain why using map instead of a for loop could have potential consequences?"

```javascript

addCustomSceneObjects = () => {
  // INIT Perlin:
  this.noise = new Perlin();
  // https://rexrainbow.github.io/phaser3-rex-notes/docs/site/perlin/

  const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
  this.geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(50, 50, 50, 50);
  this.material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    color: 0x000000,
    wireframe: true,
   });


  this.cube = new THREE.Mesh(this.geometry, this.material);
  this.scene.add(this.cube);

  this.cube.rotation.set(-0.1, 0, 0);

};


startAnimationLoop = () => {
  this.animationSpeed = performance.now() * 0.001;

  //      The waves
  var spikes = 2;
//   ðŸ”´ FOR instead of MAP
  for (
    var eachVertice = 0;
    eachVertice < this.cube.geometry.vertices.length;
    eachVertice++
  ) {
    var p = this.cube.geometry.vertices[eachVertice];
    p.normalize().multiplyScalar(
      1 +
        0.3 *
          this.noise.perlin3(
            p.x * spikes + this.animationSpeed,
            p.y * spikes,
            p.z * spikes
          )
    );
  }

};
```

### ðŸ§¶ Your code example for animating a mesh in Three.js relies on updating vertices of a geometry during each frame.
