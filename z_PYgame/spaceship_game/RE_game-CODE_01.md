- **Load several img's** [Go to section](#load_severalimgs)


- **Avoid Unecessary computation**

- - - Understanding the issue [Go to section](#expensive_comp)

## ðŸŸ  In this section: I will follow the tutorialâ€™s steps to implement <u>the image generation process</u> .

<br>

- - I will create and position **20 instances of images**.

<br>

- -  âœ‹ **Additionally, as a personal enhancement**, we will introduce a dictionary to manage multiple images more efficiently.

<br>



<br>
<br>

## ðŸŒˆ Steps:

- -  I will first **create a dictionary to manage** multiple **images** efficiently.

<br>

- - Following that, I will **implement a NEW loop** to generate 20 instances of these images.

<br>

- - - During this process, I will also address **potential issues** that might arise when handling the loop, such as ensuring unique positions and managing any possible conflicts or errors.
