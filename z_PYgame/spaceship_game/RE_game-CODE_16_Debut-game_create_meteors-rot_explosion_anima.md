## ðŸŸ¡ Explosion Animation

<br>

###  In this Lesson we will be implementing an explosion animation.

> #### When a laser hits a meteor, we want to create a captivating explosion effect that will enhance the gameplay experience.

#### This will not only make the game more engaging but also provide players with satisfying feedback when they destroy enemies.

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ§ Steps Overview


**Import the Explosion Images:** Load the explosion images that will be used in the animation.

**Create the Explosion Class:** Develop the AnimatedExplosion class to handle the animation.

**Define the Constructor and Frames:** Set up the constructor to initialize the frames as a list of surfaces.

**Trigger the Animation:** Instantiate the explosion class when a laser hits a meteor.

**Update and Draw the Animation:** Manage the animation's progress and render it on the screen.

- **Clean Up:** Ensure that the explosion instance is removed after the animation completes.

<br>
<br>
<br>


## ðŸŸ¦ Moving Forward:



## ðŸŸ  1. Import the Explosion Images

### To get started, we need to gather the images that will form our explosion animation.

<br>

---

## ðŸ’¥ Show the explosion at different stages

> #### We'll typically have a series of images that show the explosion at different stages.

> #### Make sure you have these images ready in your project directory, as we'll be loading them into our game to create a smooth animation.

---

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  2. Create the Explosion Class

> #### Next, we will create a class called `AnimatedExplosion`.

```python
#ðŸª¨ METEOR
class Meteor(pygame.sprite.Sprite):

# ðŸ’¥
class AnimateExplosion(pygame.sprite.Sprite):

```

#### This class will be responsible for handling the animation of the explosion.

#### Here's how it will work:

> ### ðŸ”« When a laser hits a meteor, we will create an instance of the `AnimatedExplosion` class.

- - ðŸ’¥ This instance will manage the sequence of explosion images, **playing them in order** to create the **illusion of an explosion**.


#### After the animation completes, the instance will disappear from the game, ensuring that it doesn't take up resources unnecessarily.

### ðŸŸ  3. Define the Constructor and Frames

ðŸŸ« **LIST of Surfaces: the teacher will call them Frames**

#### This is where we will initialize the explosion `frames`, which are crucial for creating the animation effect.

<br>

- -  ðŸŸ¢ **Each `frame`** represents a stage in the explosion sequence, and having them stored in a list allows us to easily cycle through them to create the illusion of movement.

<br>

- - Once the pygame class created, create the constructor init and add the frames, which is a list of surfaces

<br>

- ðŸ”´ Add also the position and the groups: `pos, groups` to the constructor

```python
class AnimateExplosion(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, frames,pos, groups):
```

<br>

#### Purpose of Frames


- **Visual Fluidity:** By using multiple frames, we can create a fluid animation that mimics a real explosion.

> - - #### Instead of just showing a static image, cycling through several images gives the impression of motion.


- **Control Over Animation Speed:** The number of frames and the speed at which they are displayed can be adjusted to create different explosion effects.

>For instance, a faster transition can imply a more intense explosion.

- **Resource Management:**

> #### ðŸŸ¢ Storing frames in a list makes it easy to manage the resources required for the animation, <u>as we can load them all at once</u>  and refer to them as needed.

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  4. Initialize the Sprite and Set the Initial Image


#### In this step, we will register the `AnimateExplosion` sprite with the specified groups and set the initial image for the explosion animation by using the first frame from the provided list of frames.


- i will add the version without the exception frst

```python
        super().__init__(groups)
            self.image = frames[0]

            self.rect = self.image.get_frect(center = pos)
```

### Explanation:

#### `super().__init__(groups)`:

**Calling the Parent Class Constructor:** This line calls the constructor of the parent class `(pygame.sprite.Sprite)` and passes the groups parameter to it.

- - This is important for adding the sprite to the specified groups, which lets Pygame keep track of it. This way, the sprite can be updated and drawn on the screen along with other sprites in the group.

<br>

### `self.image = frames[0]`

#### Setting the Initial Image:

- Here, we set the image attribute of the sprite to the first frame in the frames list. This will be the image displayed when the explosion animation starts.

```python
try:
    self.image = frames[0]

```
<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  5. Importing the images

#### In the images folder, there is a subfolder called explosion that contains 20 images named from 1 to 20, all in PNG format.

<br>

### ðŸŸ© You can create a list of the explosion image paths in two ways. Hereâ€™s the first method:



```python
# Load explosion images
explosion_frames = [i for i in range(21)] # Creates a list from 1 to 20
print(explosion_frames)
```
ðŸ”´ **Check your console:** you should see the numbers 1 through 20, confirming that the images are ready to be used!

#### output

```bash
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
```

<br>

#### ðŸŸ© However, thereâ€™s another way that directly gives you the file paths for the images:

```python
from os.path import join

# Method 2: Create paths to the explosion images
explosion_frames = [join('images', 'explosion', f'{i}.png') for i in range(1, 21)]
print(explosion_frames)
```

### output

```python
['images/explosion/0.png', 'images/explosion/1.png', 'images/explosion/2.png', 'images/explosion/3.png', 'images/explosion/4.png', 'images/explosion/5.png', 'images/explosion/6.png', 'images/explosion/7.png', 'images/explosion/8.png', 'images/explosion/9.png', 'images/explosion/10.png', 'images/explosion/11.png', 'images/explosion/12.png', 'images/explosion/13.png', 'images/explosion/14.png', 'images/explosion/15.png', 'images/explosion/16.png', 'images/explosion/17.png', 'images/explosion/18.png', 'images/explosion/19.png', 'images/explosion/20.png']
```

<br>

### ðŸŸ« Differences Explained


**Method 1:** This creates a list of numbers (`1 to 20`).

- - - It doesn't tell you where the images are located, **just their numbers**.

<br>

**Method 2:** This creates a list of complete **paths to the image files** (like `images/explosion/1.png`).

- - - It combines the folder names and the image numbers into a full path, which is very useful when you want to load the images later.

<br>
<br>



## ðŸŸ  6.   <u>Loading Images into Pygame</u>

### ðŸ”´ Path Considerations Based on Project Structure


#### ðŸŸ¦ Teacherâ€™s Structure:

```bash
Root Directory
audio
images
game
```


#### ðŸŸ¦ My Structure:

```bash
PROJECTGAME (Root Directory)
audio
game
  |___main.py
images
  |___explosion
     |___0.png
        # and so on ...
```

<br>

## ðŸŸ« Teachers structure  ðŸŸ« :

> ### In the previous code, you created a list of file paths to your explosion images.

- recap

```python
# Method 2: Create paths to the explosion images
explosion_frames = [join('images', 'explosion', f'{i}.png') for i in range(1, 21)]

```

#### output

```python
['images/explosion/0.png', 'images/explosion/1.png', # and SO ON...
```
