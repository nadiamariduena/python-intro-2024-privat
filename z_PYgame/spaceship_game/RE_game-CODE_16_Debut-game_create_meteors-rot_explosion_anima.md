## ðŸŸ¡ Explosion Animation

<br>

###  In this Lesson we will be implementing an explosion animation.

> #### When a laser hits a meteor, we want to create a captivating explosion effect that will enhance the gameplay experience.

#### This will not only make the game more engaging but also provide players with satisfying feedback when they destroy enemies.

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ§ Steps Overview


**Import the Explosion Images:** Load the explosion images that will be used in the animation.

**Create the Explosion Class:** Develop the AnimatedExplosion class to handle the animation.

**Define the Constructor and Frames:** Set up the constructor to initialize the frames as a list of surfaces.

**Trigger the Animation:** Instantiate the explosion class when a laser hits a meteor.

**Update and Draw the Animation:** Manage the animation's progress and render it on the screen.

- **Clean Up:** Ensure that the explosion instance is removed after the animation completes.

## ðŸŸ¦ Moving Forward:



## ðŸŸ  1. Import the Explosion Images

### To get started, we need to gather the images that will form our explosion animation.

<br>

---

## ðŸ’¥ Show the explosion at different stages

> #### We'll typically have a series of images that show the explosion at different stages.

> #### Make sure you have these images ready in your project directory, as we'll be loading them into our game to create a smooth animation.

---

<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  2. Create the Explosion Class

> #### Next, we will create a class called `AnimatedExplosion`.

```python
#ðŸª¨ METEOR
class Meteor(pygame.sprite.Sprite):

# ðŸ’¥
class AnimateExplosion(pygame.sprite.Sprite):

```

#### This class will be responsible for handling the animation of the explosion.

#### Here's how it will work:

> ### ðŸ”« When a laser hits a meteor, we will create an instance of the `AnimatedExplosion` class.

- - ðŸ’¥ This instance will manage the sequence of explosion images, **playing them in order** to create the **illusion of an explosion**.


#### After the animation completes, the instance will disappear from the game, ensuring that it doesn't take up resources unnecessarily.
