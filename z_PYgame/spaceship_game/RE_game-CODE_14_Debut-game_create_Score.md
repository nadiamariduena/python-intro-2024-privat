## ðŸŸ¦ Score

### ðŸŸ  In this lesson, weâ€™re going to learn how to set up a score system for our Pygame space shooter game!

<br>

> #### So far, weâ€™ve worked on important things like handling collisions and even setting up text colors.

> #### Now, itâ€™s time to bring everything together by adding a score that keeps track of how well the player is doing.

<br>

### ðŸŸ  A score will make the game more exciting by rewarding players for shooting down enemies or surviving for longer.

#### In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to display the score on the screen and update it as the game progresses.

This will allow us to manage and update the score as needed during gameplay.

```python
def display_score():
```
<br>

### Why a function?
