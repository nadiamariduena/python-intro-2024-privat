 <br>



<!-- ## üü¶   Moving Forward: -->

### üü† Let‚Äôs Recreate Our Previous Movements!

### üî∏ Remember What We Had Before?

> #### In the upcoming steps, we will reintroduce the movement logic that allows the player to navigate smoothly.

<br>

- - **First**, we‚Äôll copy the key direction input code into the update() method of the Player class.

- - - **Next**, we‚Äôll ensure that we **`normalize`** the direction vector to maintain consistent speed.

- - - **We‚Äôll also define the `speed` variable** to control how fast the player moves.

> - - #### Finally, we‚Äôll incorporate delta time to ensure movement remains fluid across different frame rates.



<br>

### Here‚Äôs the movement logic we were using:

 ```python

#   print(pygame.mouse.get_pos())
   # ---------KEY  ---------
   keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    player_direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
    # # `int()` is the function doing the conversion. int converts this boolean value into an integer. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0. Therefore, int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) gives 1 if the key is pressed and 0 if it is not
     player_direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])

    # # to normalize the vector, after the issue when pressing top and left at the same time
    player_direction = player_direction.normalize() if player_direction else player_direction


    # player_rect.center += player_direction * player_speed * dt

    # #MAGNITUDE
    # print((player_direction * player_speed).magnitude())
    # -----------------
    # -----------------
 ```

##  üü† Transforming the Player Class for Smooth Movement!

<br>

### üß∂ Step 1:

### üí• Move the Logic into the `Player` Class


- - -   **Instead of having movement** logic <u>in the main loop (WHILE loop)</u> , let‚Äôs **encapsulate it in the Player class!** This will make our code cleaner and more organized.

<br>

### üß∂ Step 2:

### üí• `Update` the `Player` Class

> - - - ####   We‚Äôll modify the Player class to include the movement logic directly in its `update()` method.

- - ####  This way, we can call it easily from our main game loop.

## üü† Here‚Äôs How We‚Äôll Do It:

### Add Movement Logic:

- - **Incorporate `key` presses to control the player‚Äôs** direction and **normalize** the **vector**.


### Update Position:

- - Adjust the player‚Äôs position based on the calculated direction and speed.

<br>
<br>

## üü´ STEPS

<br>

## üî∂ 1.  Move the Movement Logic

- - **Take the entire commented section** related to movement from the `WHILE` loop and paste it below the **`def update` method** in the `Player` class.

- like so:

```python
    def update(self):
        print("shipt is being updated")

      # ---------KEY  ---------
    # keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    # player_direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
    # # `int()` is the function doing the conversion. int converts this boolean value into an integer. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0. Therefore, int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) gives 1 if the key is pressed and 0 if it is not
    # player_direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])

    # # to normalize the vector, after the issue when pressing top and left at the same time
    # player_direction = player_direction.normalize() if player_direction else player_direction


    # player_rect.center += player_direction * player_speed * dt
    # print(pygame.mouse.get_pos())

    # #MAGNITUDE
    # print((player_direction * player_speed).magnitude())


all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()
```

<br>
<br>


## üî∂ 2. Insert the line `keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()` inside the `def update` method of the `Player` class.

>The **purpose of adding** `keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()` **inside** the **def update** method **is to continuously check the current state** of the **keyboard** during each frame.

```python
    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        # print("shipt is being updated")


```
