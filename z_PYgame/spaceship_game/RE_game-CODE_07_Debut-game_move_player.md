<!-- ## üü¶   Moving Forward: -->

### üü† Let‚Äôs Recreate Our Previous Movements!

### üî∏ Remember What We Had Before?

> #### In the upcoming steps, we will reintroduce the movement logic that allows the player to navigate smoothly.

<br>

- - **First**, we‚Äôll copy the key direction input code into the update() method of the Player class.

- - - **Next**, we‚Äôll ensure that we **`normalize`** the direction vector to maintain consistent speed.

- - - **We‚Äôll also define the `speed` variable** to control how fast the player moves.

> - - #### Finally, we‚Äôll incorporate delta time to ensure movement remains fluid across different frame rates.



<br>

### Here‚Äôs the movement logic we were using:

 ```python

#   print(pygame.mouse.get_pos())
   # ---------KEY  ---------
   keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    player_direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
    # # `int()` is the function doing the conversion. int converts this boolean value into an integer. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0. Therefore, int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) gives 1 if the key is pressed and 0 if it is not
     player_direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])

    # # to normalize the vector, after the issue when pressing top and left at the same time
    player_direction = player_direction.normalize() if player_direction else player_direction


    # player_rect.center += player_direction * player_speed * dt

    # #MAGNITUDE
    # print((player_direction * player_speed).magnitude())
    # -----------------
    # -----------------
 ```
