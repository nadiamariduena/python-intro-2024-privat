 <br>



<!-- ## üü¶   Moving Forward: -->

### üü† Let‚Äôs Recreate Our Previous Movements!

### üî∏ Remember What We Had Before?

> #### In the upcoming steps, we will reintroduce the movement logic that allows the player to navigate smoothly.

<br>

- - **First**, we‚Äôll copy the key direction input code into the update() method of the Player class.

- - - **Next**, we‚Äôll ensure that we **`normalize`** the direction vector to maintain consistent speed.

- - - **We‚Äôll also define the `speed` variable** to control how fast the player moves.

> - - #### Finally, we‚Äôll incorporate delta time to ensure movement remains fluid across different frame rates.



<br>

### Here‚Äôs the movement logic we were using:

 ```python

#   print(pygame.mouse.get_pos())
   # ---------KEY  ---------
   keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    player_direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
    # # `int()` is the function doing the conversion. int converts this boolean value into an integer. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0. Therefore, int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) gives 1 if the key is pressed and 0 if it is not
     player_direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])

    # # to normalize the vector, after the issue when pressing top and left at the same time
    player_direction = player_direction.normalize() if player_direction else player_direction


    # player_rect.center += player_direction * player_speed * dt

    # #MAGNITUDE
    # print((player_direction * player_speed).magnitude())
    # -----------------
    # -----------------
 ```

 <br>

##  üü† Transforming the Player Class for Smooth Movement!

<br>

### üß∂ Step 1:

### üí• Move the Logic into the `Player` Class


- - -   **Instead of having movement** logic <u>in the main loop (WHILE loop)</u> , let‚Äôs **encapsulate it in the Player class!** This will make our code cleaner and more organized.

<br>

### üß∂ Step 2:

### üí• `Update` the `Player` Class

> - - - ####   We‚Äôll modify the Player class to include the movement logic directly in its `update()` method.

- - ####  This way, we can call it easily from our main game loop.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### [2:04:10](https://youtu.be/8OMghdHP-zs?si=lDJzumH66g9rAMgc&t=7450)

## üü† Here‚Äôs How We‚Äôll Do It:

### Add Movement Logic:

- - **Incorporate `key` presses to control the player‚Äôs** direction and **normalize** the **vector**.


### Update Position:

- - Adjust the player‚Äôs position based on the calculated direction and speed.

<br>
<br>

## üü´ STEPS

<br>

## üî∂ 1.  Move the Movement Logic

- - **Take the entire commented section** related to movement from the `WHILE` loop and paste it below the **`def update` method** in the `Player` class.

- like so:

```python
    def update(self):
        print("shipt is being updated")

      # ---------KEY  ---------
    # keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    # player_direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
    # # `int()` is the function doing the conversion. int converts this boolean value into an integer. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0. Therefore, int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) gives 1 if the key is pressed and 0 if it is not
    # player_direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])

    # # to normalize the vector, after the issue when pressing top and left at the same time
    # player_direction = player_direction.normalize() if player_direction else player_direction


    # player_rect.center += player_direction * player_speed * dt
    # print(pygame.mouse.get_pos())

    # #MAGNITUDE
    # print((player_direction * player_speed).magnitude())


all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()
```

<br>
<br>


## üî∂ 2. Insert the line `keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()` inside the `def update` method of the `Player` class.

>The **purpose of adding** `keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()` **inside** the **def update** method **is to continuously check the current state** of the **keyboard** during each frame.

```python
    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        # print("shipt is being updated")


```


> - - #### This allows the player to respond to key presses in real-time, enabling smooth movement. By placing it in the update method, we ensure that the player‚Äôs movement is updated every time the game loop runs.

<br>
<br>

## üî∂ 3. Add the Direction Vector in the Player Class Initialization


- - **Before we do this**, remember that we previously grouped/**HIDE the direction vector with the speed** definition:


```python
##20 X, - 10Y axis
# VECTOR
# player_direction = pygame.math.Vector2() # This vector represents the direction and speed at which the player is moving:
# player speed
# actual movement
# player_speed = 300
# -----  move right to left loop  ---




#‚úã CLOCK:  FPS (frame per second)
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
```
<br>
<br>

## üü† Now, Include the Direction Vector in the Player Class

- - In the `__init__` **method** of the `Player` **class**, add the following line: `self.direction = pygame.Vector2()`

<br>

```python
        self.rect = self.image.get_frect(center=(WINDOW_WIDTH / 2, WINDOW_HEIGHT / 2))

        # ‚úã
        self.direction = pygame.Vector2()

    def update(self):
```
<br>

## üü´ self.direction = pygame.Vector2()

**`self.direction = pygame.Vector2()` initializes a vector to manage the player's movement direction**.

> - - ####  This **allows for easy calculations of position based on user input, simplifying movement logic**.

> - - #### Using a vector enables smooth diagonal movement and ensures consistent speed.

```python
        self.rect = self.image.get_frect(center=(WINDOW_WIDTH / 2, WINDOW_HEIGHT / 2))

        # ‚úã
        self.direction = pygame.Vector2()

    def update(self):
```
<br>

## üü´ self.direction = pygame.Vector2()

**`self.direction = pygame.Vector2()` initializes a vector to manage the player's movement direction**.

> - - ####  This **allows for easy calculations of position based on user input, simplifying movement logic**.

> - - #### Using a vector enables smooth diagonal movement and ensures consistent speed.

> - - #### It also provides flexibility for future enhancements, like adding acceleration or new movement features.

- - Overall, it sets a solid foundation for effective movement handling in the game.


<br>
<br>

## üî∂ 4. Update the Direction Lines (`x,y`) in the `update()` Method

- After completing the previous steps, **copy the x and y direction lines** and **paste** them **into the** `def update()` **method**:

<br>

```python
        player_direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
        player_direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])
```
<br>
<br>

### Once you‚Äôve pasted them, modify `player_direction` to `self.direction` for both lines:


```python
        self.direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
        self.direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])
```

<br>

> #### üü´ This ensures that the player‚Äôs movement direction is now stored in the self.direction vector, allowing for more organized and efficient handling of movement within the Player class.

<br>
<br>

## üî∂ 5. Normalize the Direction Vector

### To ensure smooth movement, it‚Äôs important to normalize the direction vector:



```python
       player_direction = player_direction.normalize() if player_direction else player_direction
```

> üî¥ **Remember to add this line**; otherwise, we may encounter the same issue we faced earlier, where the values become erratic if both the up and left keys are pressed simultaneously.

 #### Normalizing the direction vector prevents faster diagonal movement by ensuring that the player‚Äôs speed remains consistent, regardless of the input direction. This helps maintain a smooth and predictable gameplay experience.


<br>

- Don't forget to replace the **player_direction** for **self**

```python
      self.direction = self.direction.normalize() if self.direction else self.direction
```

<br>

### üî∂ Make sure your update() method looks like this:

```python
    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

        self.direction.x = int(keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) - int(keys[pygame.K_LEFT])
        self.direction.y = int(keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) - int(keys[pygame.K_UP])


        #NORMALIZE ‚úã
        self.direction = self.direction.normalize() if self.direction else self.direction
        #    print("shipt is being updated")
```

<br>
<br>

## üî∂ 6. `DeltaTime:` Integrate Speed Calculations into Player Dynamics!

#### The line `player_rect.center += self.direction * player_speed * dt` dynamically updates the player‚Äôs position by combining the direction vector with the speed and the time elapsed since the last frame.

```python
# before
player_rect.center += player_direction * player_speed * dt
# after
self.rect.center += self.direction * self.speed * dt

```

> #### This ensures that movement is smooth and responsive, adapting to player input in real time.

> - - - #### üî¥ Without this calculation, your player would remain stationary, missing out on all the action happening around them. Curious about how this simple equation keeps the game alive? Let‚Äôs explore the magic of motion!

# üüß  Global Accessibility of Delta Time (dt)

### üí• DT  parameter

**To improve the way our player moves**, we‚Äôll **incorporate the dt parameter**, which represents the time elapsed since the last frame.



> - - - #### The `delta time (dt)` variable is calculated in the main game loop, making it globally accessible throughout the entire program.

```python
while running:
    #ü§ö DELTA time
    # frame rate / division
    dt = clock.tick() / 1000
```
<br>

> ### üåê This means you can use dt in any class, including the Player class, to ensure consistent movement speed.

<br>

- - By multiplying the player‚Äôs movement by dt, you account for variations in frame rates.

-  - This ensures that the player's speed remains the same, regardless of how fast or slow the game runs. Essentially, dt helps make your game smoother and more reliable across different hardware!

# üî¥ 1) Important: Delta Time Accessibility


<br>

### üü´ <u>Another thing to keep in mind</u>  is that delta time (dt) is defined in the global scope, making it accessible within the Player class as well.
