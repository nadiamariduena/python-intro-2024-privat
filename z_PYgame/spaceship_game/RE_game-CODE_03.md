## üü° ANIMATION


- move the plane from right to left &  vice versa

- clock

 - - FPS (frames per second)



<br>
<br>

### üí• Make the player bounce from left to right

- at the moment we have the player moving to the right until it reaches the end of the screen on the right side

```python
 if player_rect.right < WINDOW_WIDTH:
        player_rect.left  += 2
```

<br>

### üü¶ 1. Moving it LEFT & RIGHT

  Create a new variable and assign the value of 1:

- - `player_direction = 1`

- - Use the player direction within the loop, hide the old animation

```python
    # player movementüí•
    player_rect.x += player_direction * 0.4

    # old anim
    # if player_rect.right < WINDOW_WIDTH:
    #     player_rect.left  += 2
```
<br>

### üåà Focus on the X axis

[<img src="../lefttoright_0_pos_frect.gif"/>]( )



## üü† Explanation

<br>

### `player_rect.x += player_direction * 0.4`

`player_rect.x +=`

-  - **updates** the **x-coordinate** of the `player_rect` **by adding this calculated amount**.

> #### This effectively moves the player rectangle horizontally on the screen based on the direction and speed of movement.


 <br>
<br>

 üü§ **If** `player_direction` is **positive +=**,

 - - `player_rect.x` **will be increased**

 > - - - (moving the player right).

 <br>

 üü§ **If** `player_direction` is **negative -=**,

 - - `player_rect.x` **will be decreased**

 > - - - (moving the player left).

<br>

####   üü§ `player_direction * 0.4`

- - calculates the amount to move the player horizontally.




<br>
<br>
<br>

## 2. üåàü¶Ñ Now I want to check if the player is OUTSIDE of the window

<br>

- Means that the player reaches the right edge and is now out of the window

```python
if player_rect.right > WINDOW_WIDTH or player_rect.left < 0:

        player_direction *= -1
```
<br>


[<img src="../lefttoright_1_pos_frect.gif"/>]( )

## üü† Explanation

<br>

## ü´ê `if player_rect.right > WINDOW_WIDTH or player_rect.left < 0:`
<br>

### üü§  `player_rect.right > WINDOW_WIDTH:`

- -  **This** condition **checks** `if` **the right edge** of the `player_rect` **has moved beyond the  `right` ‚û°Ô∏è edge** of the **screen.**

> - - - #### üç® If it has, the plane has reached the right boundary.

<br>

### üü§  `player_rect.left < 0:`

 - - **This** condition **checks** `if` **the left edge** of the `player_rect` **has moved beyond the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è`left` edge** of the window.

 > - - - #### üç® If it has, the plane has reached the left boundary.

### üü§ `or`:

- - This `logical operator` **ensures** that **if either** boundary **condition** is `true`

 > - - - ####  (i.e., the plane is **either** at the **right** edge **or left edge** of the window),

- - **the action inside** the `if` **block will be executed**.

<br>

```python
if player_rect.right > WINDOW_WIDTH or player_rect.left < 0:

        player_direction *= -1
```

### üçä `player_direction *= -1:`

- -  This line reverses the direction of movement.

<br>

- - **If** `player_direction` **was `1`** (moving right),

- - - **it becomes `-1`** (moving left).

<br>

- - **If** `player_direction` **was `-1`**,

- - - **it becomes** `1`.

> #### This effectively ‚úã <u>*changes*  the plane's movement direction when it hits either boundary</u>.


<br>
<br>

### üü¢ In other words

- The player_direction starts at 1 , moves the player to the right, and once it hits the edge, it changes to -1 to move the player to the left.



```python
#  PLAYER DIRECTION
# The player_direction starts at 1 ...
player_direction = 1
 # ‚úã


# WHILE loop ---



    # if player x direction positive +=, then it will be increased +, hence will move to the right.
    player_rect.x += player_direction * 0.4
    # if player x direction negative -=, then it will be decreased -, hence will move to the left
    #  -----  move right to left loop  ---



    # Continuously check if the player's rectangle has moved past the window's boundaries.
    if player_rect.right > WINDOW_WIDTH or player_rect.left < 0:
    # If the rectangle's right edge exceeds the window width or its left edge is less than 0,
    # it means the player has reached one of the screen edges.
    # Reverse the movement direction by multiplying `player_direction` by -1 to make the plane move in the opposite direction.
     player_direction *= -1

## üü° Clock()

### In Pygame, the `clock()` is used to manage the frame rate of your game, ensuring smooth and consistent updates by controlling the timing of each frame.

<br>


<br>

### `clock()`

- - üü† It helps regulate how often the game loop runs, which is crucial for synchronizing game actions and animations.


<br>

- - üü§ By setting a specific frame rate, the clock prevents the game from running too fast or too slow.


<br>

### Three.js

> #### Similarly, in Three.js, a clock can be used to manage time-based animations and updates, providing consistent timing for rendering and interactions.

<br>


#### Check the video: [GTA 5 FPS COMPARISON 1 FPS VS 10 FPS VS 30 FPS VS 60 FPS VS 100 FPS](https://youtu.be/ESLdzYs8Bj4?si=i0TkZpuE1tY0U4tw)


<br>
<br>


### üü¶ Understanding FPS (frames per second) helps you gauge how smoothly your game or application is running.




## üü† FPS Interpretation:

 Here's how to interpret FPS values:


<br>

**High FPS (e.g., 60 FPS or more) ‚úÖ :**

 - -  This indicates smooth performance.

 <br>

 - - - The game or application is updating quickly, and you should experience fluid motion and responsiveness.

 > - - #### This is typically considered ideal for most interactive applications.

**Low FPS (e.g., 30 FPS or less):**

- -  This suggests slower performance. The game or application is updating less frequently, which may result in choppy or stuttery visuals and reduced responsiveness. Lower FPS can affect the user experience negatively.

<br>
<br>

### üü¶ What is "Okay" FPS?

<br>

üåà**60 FPS:** Often considered the target for smooth gameplay or applications, providing a very fluid experience.

üü§**30 FPS:** Generally acceptable for many games and applications, though it may feel less smooth compared to 60 FPS.

üî¥ **Below 30 FPS:** Can be problematic and might indicate performance issues. It could lead to noticeable lag and poor user experience.

<br>

### Understanding FPS Limitations:

Monitor Capabilities: The refresh rate of your monitor can limit your FPS. For example, a 60Hz monitor can display up to 60 FPS.

- - üî¥ Hardware Constraints: üî¥ The performance of your CPU, GPU, and other components can affect your achievable FPS.


<br>
<br>


## üü° Exercise: FPS (frames per second)

 FPS tracking and display the FPS on the screen.


### üü§ Move the cube with the below keys:

- üü† a,d,w,s

```python
 # Move the player based on key presses
    if key[pygame.K_a]:
        player.move_ip(-1, 0)
    elif key[pygame.K_d]:
        player.move_ip(1, 0)
    elif key[pygame.K_w]:
        player.move_ip(0, -1)
    elif key[pygame.K_s]:
        player.move_ip(0, 1)
```
<br>

### üü§ Play with this values:

```python
# Set up FPS clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS = 60  # Set the desired FPS ü§ö
```

<br>


```python
import pygame
import sys ‚úã

pygame.init()

# Set up display
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

# Set up player
player = pygame.Rect((300, 250, 50, 50))

# Set up FPS clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS = 60  # Set the desired FPS ü§ö

run = True

while run:
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

    # Get pressed keys
    key = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    # Move the player based on key presses
    if key[pygame.K_a]:
        player.move_ip(-1, 0)
    elif key[pygame.K_d]:
        player.move_ip(1, 0)
    elif key[pygame.K_w]:
        player.move_ip(0, -1)
    elif key[pygame.K_s]:
        player.move_ip(0, 1)

    # Fill the background
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))

    # Draw the player
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), player)

    # Display FPSü§ö
    font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
    fps_text = font.render(f'FPS: {int(clock.get_fps())}', True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(fps_text, (10, 10))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.update()

    # Control the frame rate ü§ö
    clock.tick(FPS)

pygame.quit()
sys.exit()

# üü° Back to the Space shooter

<br>
<br>

## üü¶ Movement & delta time


### üü§ In this section we will `.blit` a `Surface` in a different position on every  <u>frame</u>

- You can do that through the **`x,y`** tuple or a **rect**

- [1:04:54](https://youtu.be/8OMghdHP-zs?si=J5Tgfr5vkdx7RjOM&t=3894)


<br>

## üü° `pygame.time.Clock()`


### üü§ Control the Frame rate

- add the following line to your code, just below running = True


```python
#
# running = True
# üüß CLOCK:  FPS (frame per second)
#
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
```

<br>

### ü´ê Why clock() is necessary?

 üüß Because it allows us to control the frame rate of the game, specially when we don't know the type of computer the users have.

<br>


 <br>

### üü§ AT the moment the frame rate we have is this "WHILE" loop below, but like this we have no control:


<br>


 Depending of your computer, the fps of the code below, is going to be faster or slower

- - **example:** üî¥ if this code can run in your computer at **10k** frame per seconds, then its going to be **10k fps**

- - - #### üî¥ [ but what if the computer is running Windows XP or an older version? ](#FPS_old_devices)




<br>

```python
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    display_surface.fill("lavenderblush2")


    for pos in star_positions:
        display_surface.blit(star_surf, pos)


    # player
    display_surface.blit(player_surf, player_rect)
    # meteor
    display_surface.blit(meteor_surf, meteor_rect)
    # laser
    display_surface.blit(laser_surf, laser_rect)


    player_rect.x += player_direction * 0.4
    if player_rect.right > WINDOW_WIDTH or player_rect.left < 0:

     player_direction *= -1

    # -------------
pygame.display.update()
```

<br>
<br>


### üü£ QUESTION:

> #### üü£ If I set the frame rate to 60 fps using clock.tick(60) in Pygame, but the computer is running Windows XP or an older version, how can users still get a good experience if the game is designed to run at 60 fps?

<a name="FPS_old_devices"></a>

#### ‚úÖ Chatgpt:

> #### If you hard-code your game to run at 60 FPS using clock() or similar timing functions, it can indeed cause issues on older hardware or systems with lower processing power.


<br>

### üî¥ Go to this link, there you will find other ways to implement the clock [READ MORE: a_about_clock-fps_0](../a_about_clock-fps_0_.md)



 <br>
 <br>


### 1. üü† Now that I have added the below:

 ```python
#
# running = True
# üüß CLOCK:  FPS (frame per second)
#
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
```
### 2. üü† We can call it within the WHILE loop


```python
while running:


    clock.tick() # ‚úã
```

<br>

### 3. üß∂ Setting the Frame Rate:


- **This line is crucial** because it controls the velocity of the player plane.

- - **The value you pass to** `clock.tick()` **determines the frame rate**, such as `clock.tick(60)` for 60 frames per second.


> - -  #### üçä  When you use `clock.tick(60)`, the game runs at 60 frames per second. To achieve smooth and proportional movement, you might use a multiplier like `* 0.04` to adjust the player‚Äôs movement speed:

```python
    player_rect.x += player_direction * 100
    # if player x direction negative -=, then it will be decreased -, hence will move to the left
    # - * 0.4: calculates the amount to move the player horizontally
```


<br>

[<img src="../fps__0.gif"/>]( )

<br>
<br>

### 4. üß∂ But what if i add 1 instead of 60

- In contrast, setting ‚úã `clock.tick(1)` reduces the frame rate to 1 frame per second.

- - **This** drastic **change means that each frame is significantly longer**, so you need to adjust the multiplier to maintain a similar movement speed.

> #### In this case, you might use a much larger multiplier, like ‚úã `* 100`:

```python
while running:


    clock.tick(1)
```

<br>

### 6. üß∂ Adjusting Movement:


- - The `clock.tick(1)` sets the **frame rate** to **1** frame per second.


```python
    # - * 0.4: calculates the amount to move the player horizontally
    player_rect.x += player_direction * 100
    # if player x direction negative -=, then it will be decreased -, hence will move to the left

```


### 6. üü° As you can see, its running at 1 frame per second

[<img src="../fps__2.gif"/>]( )

###  Visual Impact of Frame Rate:


- - With `clock.tick(60)`, the player moves smoothly with smaller incremental changes because the frame rate is higher.

- - However, when you switch to `clock.tick(1)`, the game updates only once per second, so you need to multiply by a larger number to move the player a reasonable distance within that single frame.

As a result, the movement appears much more pronounced with `clock.tick(1)` compared to clock.tick(60). Here‚Äôs a visual representation of how this affects the game:

<br>
<br>
