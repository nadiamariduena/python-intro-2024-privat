## ðŸŸ¡ ANIMATION


- move the plane from right to left &  vice versa

- clock

 - - FPS (frames per second)

### ðŸ’¥ Make the player bounce from left to right

- at the moment we have the player moving to the right until it reaches the end of the screen on the right side

```python
 if player_rect.right < WINDOW_WIDTH:
        player_rect.left  += 2
```

<br>

### ðŸŸ¦ 1. Moving it LEFT & RIGHT

  Create a new variable and assign the value of 1:

- - `player_direction = 1`

- - Use the player direction within the loop, hide the old animation

```python
    # player movementðŸ’¥
    player_rect.x += player_direction * 0.4

    # old anim
    # if player_rect.right < WINDOW_WIDTH:
    #     player_rect.left  += 2
```
