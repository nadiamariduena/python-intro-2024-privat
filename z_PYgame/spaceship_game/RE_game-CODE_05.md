## ðŸŸ¡ ANIMATION 3.


<br>
<br>

# ðŸŸ  Make the player move

### Make the player ship bounce around the window like the old DVD logo

> #### The ship will move around the screen and bounce off the edges, reflecting off each side just like the old DVD logo animation.

- -  When the ship reaches the boundaries of the window, it will change direction and continue moving within the screen


<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ¦ Player direction

- Right now, the ship will move towards the right side.

```python
player_direction = pygame.math.Vector2(1, 0)
# This vector represents the direction and speed at which the player is moving:
```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ¤ Change it back to this

<br>

- The player will move towards the bottom of the screen because we're adding **1** to the `y-axis` with the direction (1, **1**).
