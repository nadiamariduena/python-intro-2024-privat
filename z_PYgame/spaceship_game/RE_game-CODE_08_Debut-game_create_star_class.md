## 🫐 What We’ve Accomplished:

- -  In Lesson 8, we focused on enhancing player movement and understanding input handling in our game.

<br>

### Here’s a brief recap of what we accomplished:

**Reintroduced Movement Logic:** We copied the key direction input code into the update() method of the Player class to enable smooth navigation.

**Normalized the Direction Vector:** We ensured that the direction vector is normalized, which helps maintain consistent speed, especially when multiple keys are pressed.

**Defined the Speed Variable:** We set a speed variable to control how fast the player moves, enhancing the responsiveness of the gameplay.

**Incorporated Delta Time:** We integrated delta time (dt) to ensure that movement remains fluid and consistent across different frame rates, improving the overall game experience.

<br>
<br>

#### ⚫ Global Accessibility

**Explored Global Accessibility of Delta Time (dt):** We discussed how dt can be accessed globally and its implications for our code.

-  **Global Scope** to access Delta Time:  ( 🔺 **not a good practice in some scenarios**)

<br>

#### ⚫ `Issues with get_just_pressed()`

**Identified Issues with get_just_pressed():** We recognized that using pygame.key.get_just_pressed() might lead to errors in recent Pygame versions and noted this as a caution for future lessons.

## 🟨  Creating and Optimizing the Star Class

In this lesson, we will focus on enhancing our game by implementing a `Star class` with efficient image handling and sprite management.
