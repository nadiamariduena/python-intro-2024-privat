## 🫐 What We’ve Accomplished:

- -  In Lesson 8, we focused on enhancing player movement and understanding input handling in our game.

### Here’s a brief recap of what we accomplished:

**Reintroduced Movement Logic:** We copied the key direction input code into the update() method of the Player class to enable smooth navigation.

**Normalized the Direction Vector:** We ensured that the direction vector is normalized, which helps maintain consistent speed, especially when multiple keys are pressed.
