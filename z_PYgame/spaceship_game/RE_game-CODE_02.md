### What is the Difference between Rects & Frects

-  In Pygame, `Rect and frect (or FRect)` are **both used to represent rectangular areas**, but **they differ** mainly in the type of **precision** they **use for their coordinates and dimensions:**

<br>

## `rect` & `frect`

### âš«  Differences

ðŸ”´ **Precision:** `Rect uses integer` values(20), while `FRect uses floating-point` values(20.5).



```python
# âœ‹ rect
import pygame
rect = pygame.Rect(10, 20, 30, 40)

#
# âœ‹ FRECT (great precision: 30.5)
import pygame.freetype
frect = pygame.freetype.FRect(10.5, 20.5, 30.5, 40.5)
```

<br>

> - - ðŸ”´
it doesn't make sense to keep Rect with integers, it will be deprecated once FRect is released in 2.1.4. [Frect OR RECT](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/3643)

## ðŸŸ  About  Rect's

In Pygame, Rect objects represent rectangles with defined size and position.

- - They include a variety of **points** âš«, such as **tuples with X and Y coordinates**.

- - - Additionally, Rect objects have properties for width, height, and overall size.

### ðŸŸ¤ In Pygame, Rect objects include several <u>key âš« points</u>  that help define their position and dimensions:

<br>

**Top-left corner:** The `(x, y)` position of the rectangle's top-left corner.

```python
rect = pygame.Rect(30, 40, 100, 80)

# This creates a rectangle with:
# âœ‹
# Top-left corner at (30, 40)
# Width of 100 pixels
# Height of 80 pixels
```

<br>

**Top-right corner:** The `(x + width, y)` position of the rectangle's top-right corner.

<br>

**Bottom-left corner:** The `(x, y + height)` position of the rectangle's bottom-left corner.

**Bottom-right corner:** The `(x + width, y + height)` position of the rectangle's bottom-right corner.

<br>
<br>



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## ðŸŸ  POS & Dimensions:

<br>


- **WIDTH & HEIGHT:** Create a rectangle that is 20 pixels wide and 30 pixels tall

- **POSITION on the screen:** and place it at the position (100, 50) on the screen

```python
myRect = pygame.Rect(100, 50, 20, 30)
```

## ðŸŸ  `surface.get_rect()` / `pygame.Rect`

<br>

### ðŸŸª QUESTION: Which of the following options is more commonly used in Pygame development?


<br>

#### âœ… chatgpt:

- -  `pygame.Rect` is the most widely used and  [canonical](https://canonical.com/) way to handle rectangles in Pygame.

- - `surface.get_rect()` is a standard and commonly used method in Pygame to **obtain the bounding rectangle of a surface**.

<br>

```python
# OPT 1
pygame.Rect(pos, size)
pygame.Frect(pos, size)


# OPT 2
surface.get_rect(point = pos)
surface.get_frect(point = pos)
```

**Therefore**, `Option 1` is the **more standard and widely used approach in Pygame.**

- - If you are working with traditional Pygame development and need rectangles, youâ€™ll typically use pygame.Rect and surface.get_rect().
