### 🟠 Blitting Sprites

**Directly Blitting Sprites:** Why It’s Not Ideal  [Go to section](#DirectlyBlittingSprites_)

> - - -  Direct blitting requires manual management of each sprite's position and updates, which can become cumbersome and error-prone.

<br>

  **The Benefits of Using Sprite Groups**  [Go to section](#BenefitsofUsingSpriteGroups_)


> - - -  Sprite groups simplify sprite management by handling updates and drawing in bulk, improving code organization and performance.

  **Getting Started with Sprite Groups** [Go to section](#GettingStartedwithSpriteGroups_)

>- - -  Learn how to create and use sprite groups to streamline your game development and efficiently manage multiple sprites.

### 🟠 Adding Sprites to the Group

- - - ### 🟤 Init: Asterisk `*`

- -  - - Adding **groups** when initializing the Class: `super().__init__(*groups)`: [ ⤵️ Go to section](#ASTERISK_)

> - - - - the asterisk (*) means "unpack the elements" and is essential for properly passing the groups to the parent class's __init__ method.

# 🟡 Before Starting:


### 🟩  <u>What We’ve Accomplished: </u>



#### 🟠 Handling Inputs:

We’ve successfully set up code to manage **keyboard and mouse inputs**, allowing us to control the player and interact with the game world effectively.

#### 🟠 Player Movement:

We’ve **implemented smooth movement mechanics for the player**, ensuring consistent **speed and responsiveness**, even with **diagonal movements**.

<a name="What_We_will_Be_Doing_"></a>

## 🫐🟡 <u>What We’ll Be Doing </u>

####  💥 Creating Game Classes:

  We’ll define classes for different elements of our game.

> #### For example, a Player class for the player character, an Enemy class for enemies, and so on. Each class will manage its own behavior and properties.

####  💥 Using Sprites:

We’ll use `pygame.sprite.Sprite` to create these classes.

> #### This class helps us by automatically providing the Surface and Rect attributes and making it easier to manage updates and interactions.



####  💥 Building the Game Loop:

> ####  We’ll integrate our sprite classes into the main game loop, updating and drawing each sprite, handling collisions, and managing game states.
