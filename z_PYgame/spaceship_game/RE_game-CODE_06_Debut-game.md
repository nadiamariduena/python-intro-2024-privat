## 🫐 🟡 What is a SPRITE?


#### 🟦 In gaming, a "sprite" refers to a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene, typically representing objects or characters.





>  -  ✋ The term originated from early computer graphics where sprites were small, movable graphics elements, like a character or an item, which could be manipulated independently of the background.

<br>

- - **Sprites are usually used in 2D games**, where they are drawn over a static or dynamically changing background.

<br>

>  #### In more modern contexts, the term can also apply to certain 3D games where elements are rendered in a 2D manner, such as icons, HUD elements, or particle effects.
