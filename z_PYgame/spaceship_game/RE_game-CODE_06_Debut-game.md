## 🫐 🟡 What is a SPRITE?


#### 🟦 In gaming, a "sprite" refers to a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene, typically representing objects or characters.

>  -  ✋ The term originated from early computer graphics where sprites were small, movable graphics elements, like a character or an item, which could be manipulated independently of the background.


<br>

- - Sprites are usually used in 2D games, where they are drawn over a static or dynamically changing background.

<br>

> - - #### In more modern contexts, the term can also apply to certain 3D games where elements are rendered in a 2D manner, such as icons, HUD elements, or particle effects.

<br>

## 🟦 Key features of sprites include:


<br>

**Layering:**

 #### Sprites can be layered over or under other sprites and backgrounds to create complex scenes.


- - - **Sprites are a fundamental concept in game development**, especially for classic and indie games, due to their simplicity and versatility.

<br>

**Transparency:**

- - Sprites often have transparent backgrounds so they can blend seamlessly with the game environment.




**Animation:**

- -  Sprites can be animated by displaying a sequence of images (frames) in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement.

## 🟡 Moving Forward: Building Your Space Shooter with Classes and Sprites


Now we're ready to move into the exciting phase of building our game.


<br>
<br>


## 🟡 Why Use Classes:

### 🟤 Organization:

 As our game grows, our code can become messy.

- - - #### Classes help keep things tidy by grouping related data and functions together.

> #### This makes it easier to manage and understand.

<br>

### 🟤 Structure:

We’ll create specific classes for different game elements like the player, enemies, and other objects.

- - #### 🟦 Each class will handle its own behavior and properties, making the code modular and easier to maintain.
