### 🟣 Question: In game development, especially with big and complex games, I’m wondering if it’s okay to use more than one game loop?

### ✅ chatgpt: Using multiple game loops in a single game is generally not a common practice, especially in large and complex games.

- - 👍 The traditional approach is to use a single game loop that handles all aspects of the game’s update and rendering processes.

- - 🤔 However, there are some scenarios where a multi-loop approach might be considered, such as managing different game states or systems independently.

<br>

> ### 🟦  Here’s a detailed breakdown of the considerations and best practices:

## 🎠 Considerations for Using Multiple Game Loops 🎪




### 🟨 Complexity:

- - Multiple game loops can significantly increase the complexity of your code. Managing the synchronization between different loops and ensuring they interact correctly can become cumbersome.

### 🟨 Performance:

- - Each game loop adds its own overhead.

- - 📌 **Depending on how they are implemented, they might lead to performance issues**, such as **increased CPU usage or frame rate** drops, especially if they are not well optimized.

### 🟨 Consistency:

- - 📌 **Ensuring that all game loops are in sync can be challenging.**

- - - For example, if one loop updates game logic while another handles rendering, you might encounter issues with timing and consistency.

### 🟨 State Management:

- - **Managing different game states and transitions can be tricky.**


- - -  If each loop is responsible for different states or components, you need to ensure that they interact seamlessly.

## 🌴 Best Practices 🥥


### Use a Single Main Game Loop:

Typically, a single main game loop handles game updates, rendering, and input processing.

### This loop is often structured as follows:

#### Process Input:

- - Handle user inputs such as keyboard and mouse events.

### Update:

- - 🌈 Update the game logic, including physics, AI, and game state.


### Render:

- - Draw the game world and user interface.

### Modular Design:

- - 🌈 Instead of multiple game loops, consider breaking down your game into modular components or systems that are updated and rendered in a single loop. For example:

### Entity-Component System (ECS):

- - Use an ECS architecture to manage game entities and their components.

### Scene Management:

 - - 🌈 Use a scene or state manager to handle different parts of the game (e.g., main menu, gameplay, pause menu) without needing multiple loops.


### Asynchronous Tasks:

For tasks that need to run concurrently, such as loading resources or handling network communication, use asynchronous programming techniques or multi-threading.

#### This allows you to perform these tasks without blocking the main game loop.

### Event Systems:

🌈 Instead of having multiple loops, you can use event-driven systems to handle different types of inputs and game events.

#### For example:

### Input Events:

- - 🌈🌈Use an event system to process input events like keyboard presses and mouse clicks.


### State Changes:

- - Use state machines or event dispatchers to manage transitions between different game states.

#### Profiling and Optimization:

- - Regularly profile your game to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize as needed.

> #### Ensuring that your game loop and its components are well-optimized is crucial for maintaining smooth gameplay.


<br>

### Testing and Debugging:

>Thoroughly test your game to ensure that all components work correctly together.

> ####  Debugging multiple game loops can be complex, so having a clear and consistent approach helps in identifying and fixing issues.


### 🔴 Conclusion 🔴

#### In summary, while it is technically possible to use multiple game loops, it is usually not advisable due to the added complexity and potential performance issues.

- Instead, focusing on a single main game loop and leveraging modular design, asynchronous tasks, and event-driven systems will generally provide a more manageable and efficient approach to game development.

### 🟣 QUESTION:

When you said:

> - - Using multiple game loops in a single game is generally not a common practice, especially in large and complex games. The traditional approach is to use a single game loop that handles all aspects of the game’s update and rendering processes. However, there are some scenarios where a multi-loop approach might be considered, such as managing different game states or systems independently.

#### Do you have a game example where you handle multi-loop approach might be considered, such as managing different game states

### ✅ chatgpt:

Yes, using a multi-loop approach in games can be quite useful, especially when **dealing with different game states or subsystems that need to operate independently.**

> #### Here’s an example of how a multi-loop approach might be used in a game:


**Example:**

### 🟠  Strategy Game with Multiple Systems

#### Game Overview

- - Imagine a real-time strategy game where you have several distinct systems that need to be updated and rendered independently:

📌**World Simulation Loop:** Manages the main game world, including the game state, physics, AI, and player interactions.

**UI Loop:** Handles user interface elements, such as menus, HUD (heads-up display), and player feedback.

**Networking Loop:** Manages network communication for multiplayer aspects, including synchronization of game state between clients.

<br>

### 🌈World Simulation Loop

**Purpose:**

- - This loop handles the core game mechanics and updates the game world based on player input and AI decisions.

**Frequency:** This loop might run at a fixed time step, such as 30 times per second, to ensure consistent simulation updates.

**Tasks:**

- Process player input.

- Update AI behaviors.

- Simulate physics.

- Manage game logic.

## UI Loop

**Purpose:** This loop focuses on rendering and updating the user interface elements.

**Frequency:** This loop could run at a different rate, such as syncing with the display refresh rate (e.g., 60 Hz), to ensure smooth and responsive UI updates.

### Tasks:

- Render HUD elements.

- Update menu screens.

- Handle user input for UI interactions.

- Networking Loop

**Purpose:** This loop is dedicated to network communication and keeping all players' game states in sync.

**Frequency:** This loop might operate at a separate frequency to handle network packets and communication effectively.

#### Tasks:

- Send and receive network packets.

- Update the game state based on network messages.

- Handle network latency and synchronization issues.

### 🟣 It sounds like you're referring to games with levels or worlds that are generated dynamically as you progress.

 - - I think they are known as "procedurally generated levels" or "procedurally generated worlds," and they're often created using algorithms or AI (i dont know much about it but i saw it once and i found it really interesting). I believe there’s a well-known game from England (not sure again).

 #### ✅ chatgpt:

 - - Yes, you’re referring to games with procedurally generated levels or worlds, which use algorithms to create content dynamically rather than relying on pre-designed assets. These games can offer vast, varied experiences due to their ability to generate new content on the fly.

 The game you're thinking of from Guildford, England, is likely Minecraft. Although Minecraft isn't exclusively procedurally generated—it combines procedural generation with player-created content—it is renowned for its use of procedural generation to create its expansive and diverse worlds.

 ### 🟣 I wasn’t thinking of that game. I might have confused the city where the game was developed, which I believe is Guildford. The game I was referring to is `No Man’s Sky`.

  #### ✅ chatgpt:

  - - **No Man’s Sky**  was developed by Hello Games, which is based in the UK, but the company is located in Farnham, Surrey

## 🟡 Challenges with a Single Event Loop


### With only one event loop available, keeping track of and handling multiple events simultaneously can get messy.

> #### In a complex game, this can lead to issues with organization and readability, making it harder to manage different aspects of input handling.
