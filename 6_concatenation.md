- I need to convert the number to a string to concatenate it to the fullname

```python
#ðŸŸ¥ number to string
#I need to convert the number to a string to concatenate it to the fullname

decade = str(1982)
print(type(decade))
print(decade)
```

### like so

```python
first = 'Laure'
last = "Blaz"
##its like in js, it concatenate the 2 variables into 1
fullname = first + " " + last
print(fullname)
# in addition you can also add this below, it will add the exclamation to the full name
fullname += "!"
print(fullname)

#I need to convert the number to a string to concatenate it to the fullname

decade = str(1982)
