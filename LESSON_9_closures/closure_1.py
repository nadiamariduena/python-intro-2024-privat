    # 6 ðŸŸ¥ --- important!  here below we are not calling() the function, WE ARE ONLY "returning" it
    return play_game

#7 here TOMMY = is a new function, this tommy function  is going to handle the "parent_function" , within it i will add the value as "Tommy"
tommy = parent_function("Tommy")

# 8 calling tommy function which is holdinf the data of the parent_function and all the nested functions etc
tommy()
#
# RESULT
# #Tommy has 2 coins left.
