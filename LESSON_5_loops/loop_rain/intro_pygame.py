# 11 create the tool to draw (outside of the loop), the functioning tool logic, will be added within the WHILE loop after this.
#
#
# we want to draw as a small box on the screen. To decide where this box will go, we use four numbers:  is like saying: â€œPut a small box thatâ€™s 50 steps wide and 50 steps tall, starting 300 steps from the left and 250 steps down from the top of the screen.
player = pygame.Rect((300, 250, 50, 50))
#300, 250:  a bit towards the center of the screen


# 5 create a variable that is going to be used for the condition on the WHILE LOOP
run = True

#------------- GAME LOOP
# 6 WHILE 'run' is  (equal to true) ':' execute all the code below
while run:
    # Note: The while loop contains a nested for loop, so make sure to keep an eye on the indentation.

    # 12 THE TOOL: contain 3 arguments, the screen , the rgb and the player who is going to draw
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), player)



    #14 First thing i need to know, is which key on the keyboard is being pressed
    key = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    # W.A.S.P
    # 15 if the KEY being pressed is A so its true, then i want to ...
     # ðŸ¤š X coordinates
    if key[pygame.K_a] == True:
        #16
        # ...move the rectangle to the left, the rectangle is assigned to the variable player
        player.move_ip(-1, 0) # ip: stands for MOVE IN-PLACE
        #  between the parentheses/brackets I pass in the movement in the X  direction and the Y direction, if i am moving LEFT (X) then I am subtracting from the X coordinate and I am not affecting the Y coordinate
    elif key[pygame.K_d] == True:
        # move it to RIGHT
        player.move_ip(1, 0)

    #------------- EVENT handler
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # 7 This for loop goes through all the events that Pygame has collected.

        # We can examine each event individually to find specific ones.

        # For simplicity, we are only interested in the event that allows us to close the game window,

        # which is triggered by clicking the X in the top-right corner of the screen.


        # 8 We can detect this event with an if statement.
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            # 9 If the condition is true (i.e., the QUIT event is detected),
            # we set 'run' to False to exit the while loop, effectively closing the game.
            run = False

    # 13 Think of pygame.display.update() as a final step to show what youâ€™ve drawn.
    pygame.display.update()
    # the purpose is to refresh or update the screen with any changes that have been made.

#-------------
# 10 at this point we can run the game (which is only a black window for now)
pygame.quit()
