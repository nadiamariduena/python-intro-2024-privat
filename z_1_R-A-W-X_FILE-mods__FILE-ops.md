# ðŸŸ¡ FILE Operations

<br>

### File operations include methods for reading, writing, managing positions, and handling file closures:


<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  open():

- Function to open a file and return a corresponding file object.

#### Takes the file path and mode as arguments.


```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ   close():

- Method to close an opened file.

#### Ensures resources associated with the file are freed.


```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
file.close()

```

<br>



## ðŸŸ¨ OPEN & CLOSE

- difference between option A and option B

```python
# A
# notice this: f = open
f = open('context.txt', 'w')
f.write('i deleted all of the context.txt content')
f.close() # ðŸ”´ Failure to close the file properly can lead to issues like resource leaks or data not being fully written to the file in certain circumstances.

#
# B
# ðŸ”´ You use a with statement, which automatically handles opening and closing the file.

with open('context.txt', 'w') as f:
f.write('Hello, world!\n')
# ðŸ”´ No need to explicitly close() the file
# When the with block is exited (either normally or due to an exception), Python ensures that the file is properly closed.

```

### ðŸŸ   `read(size=-1)`:

Method to read and return the entire file content or specified number of bytes (size).


```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```
<br>

#### ðŸŸ¤ Example 3: Handling Large Files in Chunks

- For larger files, reading in chunks is more efficient. Let's assume large_file.txt contains large amounts of data.

##### Here's how you can read and print it in chunks of 1024 bytes:

```python
# Open the large file in read mode
with open('large_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    while True:
        # Read 1024 bytes from the file
        chunk = file.read(1024)
        if not chunk:
            break
        # Print the chunk or process it
        print(chunk)
#
#
# OUTPUT
#Contents of large_file.txt printed in chunks of 1024 bytes.

```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ   write(string):

- Method to write a string to a file.


#### Returns the number of characters written.

Example

```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, world!\n')

```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  readline():

ðŸ”¸ This line reads one line from the file object file and stores it in the variable line.

```python

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    line = file.readline()
#
# output: # context, it will remove the rest

```
<br>

ðŸ”¸ The **readline()** method reads characters from the file until it reaches a newline character ('**\n**') or the end of the file. It returns the line as a string including the newline character at the end, unless the end of the file has been reached.


<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  readlines():

Method to **read all lines** from the file and return them as a list.

```python

# print all lines
with open('context.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)

# output:
# ['# context\n', 'Rainbow\n', 'Horse\n', 'Zebra\n', 'Zonkey\n', 'Donkey']
```

<br>

### ðŸŸ  `seek(offset, whence=0):`

Method to move the file pointer to a specific position.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    file.seek(10)  # Move to the 10th byte
    content = file.read()
```

offset specifies the number of bytes to move.
whence (optional) specifies the reference point (0 for start of file, 1 for current position, 2 for end of file).

## ðŸŸª QUESTION:  i have no idea about bytes in computers, i didnt get this in my frontend classes,  so this is my first time, Can you explain it?

#### âœ… chatgpt: Understanding bytes and their relationship to file handling in Python is fundamental to grasping how `seek()` operates. Let's clarify the concept of bytes in the context of file handling:
