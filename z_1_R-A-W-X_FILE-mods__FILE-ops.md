# ðŸŸ¡ FILE Operations

<br>

### File operations include methods for reading, writing, managing positions, and handling file closures:


<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ  open():

- Function to open a file and return a corresponding file object.

#### Takes the file path and mode as arguments.


```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ   close():

- Method to close an opened file.

#### Ensures resources associated with the file are freed.


```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
file.close()

```

<br>



## ðŸŸ¨ OPEN & CLOSE

- difference between option A and option B

```python
# A
# notice this: f = open
f = open('context.txt', 'w')
f.write('i deleted all of the context.txt content')

```

### ðŸŸ   `read(size=-1)`:

Method to read and return the entire file content or specified number of bytes (size).


```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```
<br>

#### ðŸŸ¤ Example 3: Handling Large Files in Chunks

- For larger files, reading in chunks is more efficient. Let's assume large_file.txt contains large amounts of data.

##### Here's how you can read and print it in chunks of 1024 bytes:

```python
# Open the large file in read mode
with open('large_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    while True:
        # Read 1024 bytes from the file
        chunk = file.read(1024)
        if not chunk:
            break
        # Print the chunk or process it
        print(chunk)
#
#
# OUTPUT
#Contents of large_file.txt printed in chunks of 1024 bytes.

```

<br>
<br>

### ðŸŸ   write(string):

- Method to write a string to a file.


#### Returns the number of characters written.

Example

```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, world!\n')

```
