> Python automatically stores the value of the last expression in the interpreter to a particular variable called "\_." You can also assign these value to another variable if you want.

You can use it as a normal variable. See the **example:**

```python
>>> 5 + 4
9
>>> _     # 🪄 Magic! It remembers the last result
9
>>> _ + 6  # 🌠 Adding more magic, because why not?
15
>>> _     # 🔥  Still on fire with the last result
15
>>> a = _  # 🦸‍♂️ Let's give the hero a cape and a new name
>>> a
15


```
