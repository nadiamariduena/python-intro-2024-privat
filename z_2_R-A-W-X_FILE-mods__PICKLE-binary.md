 ## 🟡 PICKLE

 <br>

 ### ⚠️ I came across the topic of Pickle while researching something else, and it piqued my interest. However, I must admit that I am a total beginner in Python, which makes using it comfortably quite challenging for me.

 - 🟦 **Pickle** is a Python **module** used **for serializing and deserializing** Python `objects{}`, essentially allowing you to convert Python objects into a byte stream (serialization) that can be easily stored or transmitted, and later reconstruct them back into their original form (deserialization). 🤔

- - Serialization is particularly **useful when you need to save the state of a Python object to disk or send it over a network** 💻 , as it converts complex Python objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. On the other hand, deserialization reconstructs Python objects from the serialized byte stream.
