```

## Basic Usage Example


- Here's a simple example of how you might use Pillow in Python:

<br>

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open an image file
with Image.open('example.jpg') as img:
    # Perform some operations
    img = img.rotate(45)  # Rotate the image by 45 degrees
    img = img.resize((200, 200))  # Resize the image to 200x200 pixels

    # Save the modified image
    img.save('modified_example.jpg')

```
