<br>

## 🫐 Here's a brief overview of Pillow's capabilities and purposes:

<br>

### 🟠 Purpose of Pillow

<br>

**Image Manipulation:**

- - Allows for various operations on images such as cropping, resizing, rotating, and filtering.

<br>

**Image Creation:**

- - Can generate new images from scratch or draw text and shapes on images.

<br>

**File Conversion:** Supports converting images between different formats (e.g., PNG to JPEG).

<br>

**Enhanced Functionality:**

- -  Provides additional features beyond what the standard Python Imaging Library (PIL) offers, such as more format support and improved performance.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## 🟦 Installation

```python

pip install pillow

```

## Basic Usage Example


- Here's a simple example of how you might use Pillow in Python:

<br>

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open an image file
with Image.open('example.jpg') as img:
    # Perform some operations
    img = img.rotate(45)  # Rotate the image by 45 degrees
    img = img.resize((200, 200))  # Resize the image to 200x200 pixels

    # Save the modified image
    img.save('modified_example.jpg')

```
