## ðŸ‘¾ I Use AI for my studies

### Why I use AI for answers

- I use chatgpt to generate the answers, as most of the things you will see on Python are similar or close to javascript and other languages, so its not necessary to reinvent the wheel (on responses) that is why I use AI, also because i am dyslexic so the way i structure the answers will always be chaotic for non dyslexic :)

### Plagiarism

- there is nothing to plagiarize when learning from youtube tutorials, specially on the basics
