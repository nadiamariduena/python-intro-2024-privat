> ðŸ”´ If you are trying to develop a python web-based application using Django. It is best to identify which Django version will suit your requirements before rushing to identify the python version. This is because ðŸ‘¾ **some Django versions are only available for latest python releases**.

#### It's advisable to steer clear of the most recent Python releases for several reasons:


  ðŸ”¸ Firstly, while most **new versions** of Python are generally stable, there's always a possibility of **undiscovered bugs** that could pose challenges as your application nears deployment.

 ðŸ”¸ Secondly, not all Python packages may have caught up to the latest releases, potentially causing **compatibility issues**.

## ðŸ”´ Avoid Very Old Releases


ðŸ”¸ Similarly, **it's wise to avoid very old Python** releases. For instance, unless you have compelling reasons to use Python 2.7 in 2022, it's not recommended.

ðŸ”¸ Likewise, `Python 3.7`, slated to reach its **end-of-life in 2023**, isn't ideal for long-term projects requiring ongoing maintenance. By the time development concludes, transitioning to a newer Python version will likely be necessary.
