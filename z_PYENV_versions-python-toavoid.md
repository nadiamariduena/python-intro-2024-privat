## ðŸŸ  Avoid Latest Releases

<br>

#### It's advisable to steer clear of the most recent Python releases for several reasons:


  ðŸ”¸ Firstly, while most **new versions** of Python are generally stable, there's always a possibility of **undiscovered bugs** that could pose challenges as your application nears deployment.

 ðŸ”¸ Secondly, not all Python packages may have caught up to the latest releases, potentially causing **compatibility issues**.

## ðŸ”´ Avoid Very Old Releases


ðŸ”¸ Similarly, **it's wise to avoid very old Python** releases. For instance, unless you have compelling reasons to use Python 2.7 in 2022, it's not recommended.
