> 🔴 If you are trying to develop a python web-based application using Django. It is best to identify which Django version will suit your requirements before rushing to identify the python version. This is because 👾 **some Django versions are only available for latest python releases**.

- For instance, **Django 4 requires python version 3.8+.** Older python releases are not supported. So, if you want to use Django 4, it does not make sense to do analysis of the python versions before 3.8.

## 🟠 Conclusion
There is no fixed metrics that can be used to identify an appropriate python version for you. The “correct” python version might be different for different use case.

#### It's advisable to steer clear of the most recent Python releases for several reasons:


  🔸 Firstly, while most **new versions** of Python are generally stable, there's always a possibility of **undiscovered bugs** that could pose challenges as your application nears deployment.

 🔸 Secondly, not all Python packages may have caught up to the latest releases, potentially causing **compatibility issues**.

## 🔴 Avoid Very Old Releases


🔸 Similarly, **it's wise to avoid very old Python** releases. For instance, unless you have compelling reasons to use Python 2.7 in 2022, it's not recommended.

🔸 Likewise, `Python 3.7`, slated to reach its **end-of-life in 2023**, isn't ideal for long-term projects requiring ongoing maintenance. By the time development concludes, transitioning to a newer Python version will likely be necessary.
