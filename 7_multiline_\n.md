## Default

- first i will show you a basic way to write a text like and use multiline to add a second text, but this is not the common way to do it

# 🟠 Multiple lines

multiline = '''
Hey, how are you?

I was just checking in.
                         All good things
'''
print(multiline)
```

#### result

```javascript
Hey, how are you?

I was just checking in.
                         All good things
```

## Using

```python
#

#
sentence = 'I\'m back at work!\tHey!\n\nWhere\'s this at \\located'
print(sentence)
#
#
# RESULT
